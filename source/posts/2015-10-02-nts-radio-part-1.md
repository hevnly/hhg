Wander aimlessly down Kingsland road, amidst Dalston's perpetual hustle and bustle, seemingly engulfed in the cacophony of Ridley road market and the never-ending stream of double deckers, and it's easy to miss the turn-off to Gillett square. A granite-paved courtyard a mere stumble from the high street, this intimate opening in the heart of east London's concrete jungle occupies a patch of relative tranquility and pedestrianized space.

Nestled within its borders are a handful of cafés, two jazz bars and eateries offering grub from far-flung corners of the globe, but crucially this unassuming, locally run hub also plays host to one of London's foremost digital music entities, NTS radio.

Exploring the station's humble beginnings and charting its meteoric rise to global acclaim, leading underground music publication [Urban Essence](http://www.urban-essence.net/) joins forces with HHG in this exclusive interview with two of the station's key minds.

*'It's all about the passion…. the hosts need to know what they do and love it'*

For the past four years, NTS has been churning out forward-thinking radio content from its intimate studio in Hackney to the peripheries of the globe. Such is the station's disarmingly humble exterior that international guest DJs often struggle to find it, narrowly missing their sets. Launched back in 2011, NTS represented a fresh start for its founder, the affable Nigerian-born Femi Adeyemi. Having just been sacked for the second time from a digital marketing job in the fashion industry and faced with the harsh economic realities of London living, Femi found himself at a pivotal crossroads in his life. "I decided i couldn't work with anyone", he says, in true entrepreneurial spirit.

> Drawn in by the allure of pirate radio stations, such as the long-running Kiss FM, illicitly beaming the sounds of garage, hip hop and jungle across the airwaves

When presented with an offer to use one of Gillett square's self-contained units for a new endeavour, Femi saw the prospect of realizing a long-held ambition to start his own radio station. Like much of the capital's youth in the early 2000s, Femi was drawn in by the allure of pirate radio stations, such as the long-running Kiss FM, illicitly beaming the sounds of garage, hip hop and jungle across the airwaves. One summer, he tried his hand at launching his own station from a friend's flat in Edmonton, but admits, "It was more of a thing to try and get girls round…and it worked".

The station, which they never got around to naming, allowed Femi to flex his musical muscle via an accessible platform, albeit one restrained by the reach of their modest antenna. But it wasn't to last, citing the steep technical learning curve of DIY radio on a college budget and the lengthy bus rides from his home in archway as reasons for its ultimate demise.

At university, Femi developed his fascination for radio in all its forms, ravenously consuming everything from indie-grunge on rock radio, to sports and political talk shows on talk sport and the BBC. His passion even drew his gaze across the atlantic, discovering the extensive digital archives of american college radio stations like New Jersey's WFMU and California's KCRW.

*NTS radio wants offers a middle ground.*

While pirate stations continued to battle, very publically, with ofcom and the government throughout the 2000s, Femi looked to the technological advancements happening around him for inspiration. With broadband internet, audio (and video) streaming became very possible, very attainable solutions for the music industry, an industry which was in desperate need of new ideas. platforms like Myspace and Last.FM, as well as much of FM radio, had become exhausted and outdated, crucially because they hadn't caught up to the need for real-time engagement with their users and audiences. Internet radio bridged that gap, and from this, NTS radio was born.

Comprised of a staggering 200 hosts, the roster is made up of tastemakers and influencers born or based in London, devoted specialists to niche styles seldom represented on mainstream radio. With just one daily show, The Do!! You!! breakfast show with Charlie Bones, most shows air on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, which allows for the significant rotation necessary for the station's ambitious programming.

> It's all about balance, covering all the bases, genre wise

Their ethos is simple. "It's all about balance, covering all the bases, genre wise", says the station's managing director sean mcauliffe, "and the best of who we think can represent that, at the top". From experimental drone and enchanting Japanese ballads, to cutting edge techno and timeless R&B classics, the station offers a window into the vast array of sounds shaping London's sonic landscape. "It's all about the passion…[the hosts] need to know what they do and love it".

When at one stage that balance inadvertently tipped to a slight predominance of shows playing club-oriented music, the programming team acted to restore the equilibrium. "There was a period for like a year where the perception of listeners was that NTS was predominantly a dance music station and we were like "what the fuck is going on?" because a lot of the parties we threw were dance parties and the other thing was that it did just start to blurt out the radio so we did have to cull it and bring back some other organic shows."

Curation, then, is essential and that reflects in much of the programming. With no show is this more true than record store rotation, which sees local retailers like Kristina records, Flashback, Rough Trade and Manchester-based Boomkat take to the airwaves with the latest and greatest from their respective shelves. While record store staff the world over may have a reputation of being fearsomely cliquey, these people occupy a pivotal place between labels and consumers and there's no denying their encyclopedic knowledge. Sean "grew up working in record stores and I know from the people I encountered that those are the ones who know everything about music. They're the right people to have on the radio, and they're conversing everyday with customers". It's innovative shows like this that show the pioneering attitude NTS has become synonymous with.
