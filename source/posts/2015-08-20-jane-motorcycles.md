coffee and motorcycles stereotypically have nothing in common. they’re a pairing as abstract and unusual as they come. but jane motorcycles – a custom motorbike garage-cum-coffee shop hybrid in brooklyn has smashed these two sub-cultures together – and the outcome is truly special.

you’d be hard pressed to find a twosome like adam kallen and alex dimattio. one is a former felon who has served time and is as new york as they come. the other is a los angeles native with an equally turbulent past. both happily divorced from alcohol and both are spiritual converts searching for life’s answers through a shared dream. a serendipitous meeting led to them squeezing their lives lemons into a proverbial lemonade as fresh as the concept they have crafted together.

with its pristine white walls, neck-craning high ceilings, clean lines and minimal colour palette, jane looks and definitely feels more like a contemporary art gallery than the dark, dirty, grimy workshop your prejudiced preconceptions would have you imagine. the aroma of freshly ground coffee breezes through the air, complemented by dulcet tunes that cascade through the vast, daylight-filled space. polished custom motorcycles dotted around ‘workshop’ lean gently, posing like works of art next to colourful potted plants. it is immediately clear that this is an extraordinary place.

home to a beautiful selection of motorcycles, barista standard coffee, fluffy baked goods, fashion, books and art – jane is a culmination of all things loved by alex and adam.

>‘it was a complete shot in the dark…’

gazing proudly from from their office overlooking the space, the co-owners recount jane’s humble and honest beginnings in the heart of williamsburg. ‘it was a complete shot in the dark’ shrugs adam as he sips his freshly brewed iced coffee. ‘we didn’t know exactly what jane would be, but we knew we wanted to create a fun, non-stressful hangout place’. the duo opened their first store in 2013 with a ‘bare bones offering of 6 helmets and some t-shirts’.

they built it out themselves – swinging hammers, sanding floors and painting walls but most importantly staying true to their vision. with adam’s well honed fashion/tech expertise and alex’s natural affinity and background in motorcycles, the men built up a healthy, loyal fanbase within the cafe/motorcycle niches. unsurprisingly, the community response was overwhelmingly positive – fast-forward two years and ‘jane’ was born. this time, they called up on their past experiences and learned from their mistakes in life and business. a lesson well learned it would seem.

>‘we’re just two guys trying to create a community that people can connect to and feel a part of’

one such lesson was that coffee is always a good idea. a minimal, clean, white coffee bar stylishly angles its way from the workshop-style garage entrance. perched around it are individuals from every walk of life – bikers in their leathers, parents with their children, even people with their dogs. adam’s love for the bean resulted in a collaboration with [parlour coffee](http://parlorcoffee.com/), a micro-roaster indigenous to brooklyn.

great coffee plays a lead role in this new story and it was important to adam that the right kind was served. parlour coffee’s ethically sourced beans was an immediate attraction – ‘alex and i are both very spiritual people, we like to have fun and remain humble…we want to give back and help others – that’s the best way to help ourselves’…not only have adam and alex created their own jane motorcycles brand (with accessories ranging from clothing to deerskin gloves fabricated in japan and biking gear developed in new york) they have also managed to craft and emulate the community feeling found on the gridded streets that embrace their novel concept. it is clear that jane transcends motorcycles and is a place where nobody looks or even feels out of place.

in between the unique mix of metal and fabric, a curated selection of motorcycle accessories, grooming products, magazines and artwork is thoughtfully arranged throughout the open space. printed in large black letters, the name ‘jane’ spans plainly and proudly across the otherwise bare wall. directly below it, the first motorcycle jointly built by adam and alex, a yamaha xs650, quite literally takes centre stage.

with story-filled eyes, alex quips that jane motorcycles is a reinvention of both their lives. for alex, the one constant has always been motorcycles (he has ridden for as long as he can remember) jane, a motorcycle riding girl from his childhood memories, inspired them to build the business of their american dreams. the concept has given both men a new lease on life and the opportunity to be creative. it is a solid reflection of both characters and a place in gear with their constant pursuit of happiness.

a welcome oasis surrounded by an urban sprawl as gritty and turbulent as the pasts of its founders, adam and alex have redefined the ‘traditional’ concept of a motorcycle garage. the spawn of a shared vision, honest hard work, self belief and determination; jane motorcycles is an outstanding tile in the beautiful mosaic that is brooklyn.
