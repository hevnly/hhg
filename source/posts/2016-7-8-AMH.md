AMH (Ashley Marc Hovel) a Berlin based contemporary menswear line launched in 2009, carries the initials of the designers name and is concentrated on premium streetwear. The SS16 collection takes inspiration from Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson 1992 cult classic “White Men Can’t Jump”. Through allusions of the films vibe through quotes, prints, silhouettes, bold expression of views and the rise of street-ball fashion, the collection is titled - WIN | LOSE.  

HHG takes to the backstreets of London’s China town to look at the latest collection.
