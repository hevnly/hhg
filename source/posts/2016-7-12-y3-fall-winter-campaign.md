In promotion of its upcoming Autumn/Winter 2016 collection, Y-3 releases its second campaign of the year. The unconventional video lookbook previews the upcoming collection, stripping down to an essential aesthetic of rebellious modernism with a tough, industrial edge. The collection recalls and combines two stylistic makers of the 1990s - rave culture and minimalism - to present an ultra-modern view on sports attire. Using an abandoned warehouse as the main stage, the clean white walls combined with decorous light installations allow for the garments, in their opposing black colour scheme to protrude.
