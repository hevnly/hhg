Ai Weiwei’s father, the renown revolutionary Chinese poet, Ai Quing, was an officer in Chairman Mao’s Communist party. Until 1956 he was the chief adviser on literary policy but a year before his son’s birth, in a moment of profound clarity, he wrote and published the poetical allegory “The Gardener’s Dream”, which speaks of a rose gardener who has an epiphany and realises that he’s been discriminating against all the other beautiful flowers in the world. This overt comment on Chinese governmental regime was immediately recognised as a threat to Mao’s “New World” and he was banished, with his pregnant wife, into exile. Scarcely months later, Ai Weiwei was born into a socially and politically ostracised family, living on the edge of the Gobi desert. His “Rightist” father was blacklisted and forced to clean toilets and engage in manual labour for the next twenty years.

After Mao’s death. Ai Qing was granted a pardon and he, his wife and his son were allowed back to Beijing. Upon their return, however, at the age of nineteen, after labouring with his father most of his young life, Ai Weiwei informed his parents that he was freeing himself from the shackles of his circumstances, moving to New York City and that he would not be returning.

Ai began to experience the freedom of democracy and the artistic exploration of self and society. In this new, liberal culture he was finally afforded the opportunity to experiment with his own artistic philosophy after encountering influences from Duchamp to Warhol. He allowed himself to explore the concept of not what is art? But when is art? Reflecting on this period of his life Ai remembers that “there was a lot of struggle and a lot of uncertainty”. In 1988 a peaceful congregation of artists and creatives was disbanded in Tompkins Square Park, NY. The congregation soon became a protest and then a full blown riot. Ai was present at the incident with his camera and documented his first experience of a civil rights movement against the government and its police. He described the experience as “fascinating”. Witnessing, first hand, the might of empowered ordinary people, en masse, was something that would stay with Ai for the rest of his creative career.

Soon though, Ai was brought back to China and to the sick bed of his father. Almost as soon as he returned, the massacre of Tiananmen Square took place. These two experiences awakened in him his deep connection with China and his responsibility to take action against the injustice happening there. In the early nineties he published three revolutionary books reflecting the critical condition of national culture. These books were considered by the Chinese government to contain illegal material so Ai and his collaborators were forced to have them printed and distributed in secret to avoid imprisonment. They became a sensation throughout the art world as un unflinching artistic critique on the unacceptable status quo.

Four years after the death of his father in 1996, Ai began on the path of a lifelong project. He started to explore the concept of taking deeply valued, everyday objects and wilfully distorting them to create something that has no regard for its intended purpose. He says of this journey “If you destroy something, make the whole act very graceful so that the original and the new can co-exist in their new body.” A symbiosis of the practical and the historical with the surreal and the contemporary.

*Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn*

An earthquake in 2009 saw the horrific destruction of a large residential area in the Szechuan Province in China where one hundred thousand people lost their lives. Amongst the outcry and  devastation was the accusation, by many, that most of the schools had not withstood the shock of the earthquake while many surrounding buildings had, inferring government negligence, pertaining to the safety of the children, by cutting corners on state building costs. Ai was outraged and determined to protest, gathered nine thousand children's rucksacks and hung them on the outer wall of the Munich Museum of Art spelling out the words “She lived happily in this world for seven years.”, the grieving words of one young girl’s mother. This political message was immediately picked up by the Chinese government and Ai, his father’s son, was put under tight surveillance. Ai tells of his Twitter account being deleted, his telephones being tapped, cameras installed outside his house and tails following him around the street. “It’s kind of terrifying if you think about it”, he says. He speaks not with a sense of paranoia but with a matter of fact pragmatism that only someone used to intimidation tactics might. Far from being discouraged he insists “This is the core value of an artist. To fight for your rights and clearly express who you are”. I’m not sure most artist would agree with the first part of that, however, a staunch political activist definitely would. And that’s the power of the the man. He’s able to reach out so many people because of his duel purpose in using his art to feed his politics and his politics to feed his art. It’s a phenomenally intelligent marriage of means.

The following year saw his exhibition Sunflower Seeds at the Tate Modern touch the world. Sixteen hundred Chinese artisans had individually sculpted and painted one hundred million sunflower seeds over the course of two and a half years, which were poured onto the floor of the gallery and the public invited to walk, lay, dig, play; whatever they wanted with them. The concept was a monument to Chinese poverty and a symbol of the transformation in overcoming it. Ai’s belief in the  power of change poetically manifested.

Five years later, and having only just had his passport reinstated by the Chinese authorities, the Royal Academy are hosting a new exhibition of Ai’s work. As usual his political thought is clear. A corner of porcelain crabs climbing atop one another marks the event at which he was ironically celebrating the governments destruction of his studio by inviting friends to a crab dinner. He was illegally detained by the police and never reached the feast ; Coca-Cola logo’s printed onto priceless ancient vases, which now after surviving two thousand years of life are worth more for having been covered in Ai’s messy paint ; Piles of rust metal bars salvaged from the 2008 earthquake, all ninety tonnes straightened by hand as an act of remembrance to the five thousand dead children, a concept he might well have concocted while being illegally imprisoned for almost three months following the incident.

For Ai Weiwei art is about “individual interpretation”. He’s not pushing a message. There’s no ‘getting it’. He just wants to get people to think for themselves and ask the right questions.
