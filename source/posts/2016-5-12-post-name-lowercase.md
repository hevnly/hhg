Trainers stereotypically may have been know to be an essential piece of masculine wardrobe and for years the athletic and outdoor industries systematically ignored the female consumers. Today, the there’s a noticeable shift in the market and staple brands such as Nike, Vans and Adidas have made a drive to make sneaker culture more inclusive of women.
