it was kansas-based jazz saxophonist lester “prez” young who popularised the word ‘cool’ as a term of approval. or so the story goes. young was part of an early jazz movement that would morph from a black sub-culture into one of the cornerstones of popular culture. but given the extent of his influence on both music and 1940s hipster jargon, he remains a relatively unknown figure.

not long before young’s death, electric blues—another music genre that had afro-american roots—started to gain traction in popular culture, allowing genres such as rock ‘n’ roll and rockabilly to evolve in the process. it’s unlikely that we would have heard about johnny cash walking the line or even seen the king’s brylcreem’d pomp were it not for the music that originated from afro-american culture. like elvis himself said, ‘rock ‘n’ roll has been around for many years. it used to be called rhythm and blues.’

ever since the birth of jazz, it’s been clear that black culture has shaped and defined popular culture in a profound way. so much so, that—now more than ever—it’s often difficult to disassociate the two.

but what is black culture? 

director justin simien says that black culture has been important for popular culture. but ‘it’s a fluid and a multifaceted, often contradictory thing.’ that’s very different, of course, to what he defines as a ‘lifestyle standard made of assumptions about black identity’, which sometimes gets labelled as black culture. it’s an important distinction to make when considering the relationship between black culture(s) and mainstream popular culture as it developed throughout the latter half of the twentieth century.

throughout the 60s and 70s, black cultural influences continued to make an impact on popular culture. increasingly, music and fashion became visibly connected. disco was a prime example. the celebrated black designer stephen burrows—who has recently designed pieces for oprah winfrey, naomi campbell, and michelle obama, to name just a few clients—pretty much owned the disco scene back in the late 60s and early 70s, producing playful, exuberant pieces that reflected the music itself. as youth culture got bigger and bigger, clothing became a way of expressing who you were and, perhaps most crucially, what music you listened to.

but it wasn’t until the 80s that the commercial opportunities of this phenomenon were properly realized. the watershed moment came during run dmc’s 1986 madison square gardens performance of the ‘raising hell’ tour. senior adidas employee angelo anastasio happened to be attending when he was amazed by the sight of tens of thousands of fans lifting their adidas trainers into the air after answering the call from those on stage. anastasio reportedly sprinted back to adidas hq. and within days, run dmc became the first hip hop group to sign a million-dollar endorsement deal. success soon followed: limited edition trainers were released and advertisements of rev run, d.m.c. and jam master jay decked out in the famous three-striped shellsuits were everywhere. sales rocketed. the band and the brand became synonymous.

it’s often taken an innovation or an innovator from within black culture to insure the success and wide-ranging appeal of a particular brand’s product. in other words, it has often taken someone or something from black culture to make a brand product cool.
