In-Grid has a simple mission. They create white shirts for women. With just nine styles of shirt available, its clear this is their area of expertise. Each shirt although clean and simple has great detailing. A kimono sleeve, high V-neck, rounded collar - it's these variations that make them highly wearable items.
