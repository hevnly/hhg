Merging minimalist classics with captivating statement pieces, Our Legacy’s position at the forefront of contemporary menswear is secured and the legacy they look to building is far beyond that of a label celebrating only its tenth year in 2015.

The label began when a couple of childhood friends started making t-shirts. Jockum Hallin and Christopher Nying, originally from the small Swedish city of Jönköping, met again in Gothenburg and later found themselves both living in Stockholm. Nying was studying art and fashion communication whilst Hallin ran a fashion sales agency. From printing t-shirt samples in Nying’s father’s cellar they would go on to release their first complete line in 2007 and be stocked in the very shops they grew up admiring – namely Gothenburg’s NK mens trend and Copenhagen’s Storm. Now you’ll find their collections in leading outlets across the globe and last year saw the opening of their first UK store in Soho’s Silver Place.

This development pays testament to a label not afraid to stay dedicated to menswear. Reinterpreted classics have become a favourite staple of all collections. A reduction of recognisable aesthetics creates a sense of refinement rather than simplicity. The focus is often, instead, on weight, texture and dyeing techniques. and their fabrics are carefully sourced from all over the world, and used in innovative ways, to ensure their creations stand out.

By staying off the catwalk the inspiration behind the clothes becomes less isolated by trends and more real-world. In this way workwear can truly be married to fashion – literally in the case of 2013‘s Autumn/Winter line ‘official’ which used fabric from discontinued lufthansa uniforms. Hybrid garments consistently impress – often an added zip, pocket or even just a line of stitching replace the use of logos or glaring prints to become our legacy’s trademark. ‘Tech blousons’, ‘artisan lab jackets’, ‘lizard parkas’ and ‘1950’s shirts’ look as elegant in anthracite linens as they do in Turkish cotton or Chinese silk.

The current 2015 Autumn/Winter collection ‘ten’, celebrates the anniversary by returning to the influences and favourite styles of the past ten years whilst also bringing something new. Again, cut and fit come to the fore. Oversized detail on the short cut overcoats lends a more striking first impression to staple winter-wear and the stunning German shearling bomber and puffed jackets benefit from a boxy cut that perfectly complement other items worn.

>The brand's success is rooted in the tailored fit and versatility of its garments.

Fabric choice also elevates known styles. Black senegalese suede hide used in the short parker adds a high-fashion sheen to a staple classic whilst the futuristic sp pullover sweat in metallic olive is made from fabric sourced in Korea. ‘Ten’ sees Our Legacy reaching new heights by looking to the past but also in fearlessly extending their increasingly experimental range.

There will always be exciting labels, but few can build a long-lasting heritage. Our Legacy’s desire to combine progressive style with timeless appeal promises just that.
