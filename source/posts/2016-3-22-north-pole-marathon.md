With temperatures dropping as low as -15˚ celsius, the North Pole Marathon has rightly earned itself the title: ‘World’s Coolest Marathon’.

Since the first race - a solo effort by Irish athlete, founder, and race director: Richard Donovan - back in 2002, the North Pole Marathon has seen a steady increase in attendees. Most participants are familiar with marathon-running but wish to trade tarmac and high-rise for the Pole’s beautiful desolate landscape.

However, they soon find the race far more than just a change of scenery.

To gain confidence in their gear and abilities, some athletes undertake specialist training sessions using an ‘environmental chamber’: which simulates the temperature and conditions of the race. A few runners have even been known to exercise in industrial freezers.

*Winter temperatures at the North Pole can range from about −50 to −13 °C, averaging around −31 °C*

Maintaining core temperature is essential to performance. Runners must wear enough layers to prevent ice from dampening their body and freezing, but not too many that they sweat profusely and this freezes also.

The soft terrain is tough under foot; ‘It’s like running on sugar’, as one runner describes it. The ground is rarely flat and can be icy in places. Runners find it difficult to differentiate terrain against the white desert in clear conditions. Prevailing snow-screens make it infinitely harder and many are forced to concentrate on their feet just to avoid tripping over.

Taking such conditions into account, it is hardly surprising to hear runners frequently commend the event's camaraderie over competition. As female winner Fiona Oathes notes:

>‘You don’t look at other runners and think “I can take you down” or “I can beat you”, you are thinking “I hope we all get round in one piece!” '

One question remains: what does one gain from testing the limits of the body in this way? Not only from the challenge of a formidable environment, but what does one gain from the act of running more generally?

People who run often speak of ‘a wondering mind’, or of ‘having important dialogues with themselves’. Many feel that by focusing on the esoteric, they can physically push themselves further.

Matan Rochlitz and Ivo Gormley’s short film ‘The Runners’ explores this pensive (and surprisingly candid) atmosphere runners so often report. Their urban subjects explore themes from; absolute human values and the creation of the universe, through to their most intimate problems and failures.

Runners also spoke about the pressures of business and its highly competitive environment. studies suggest that by confronting the hardships of this goal-oriented activity, runners cultivate an 'emotional control’ which can then be applied to their life. The fixed distance of a race or lap of the park allows runners to set goals and take responsibility for achieving them. Pitted against the often indeterminate nature of life and work, we see how running offers people a mechanism of control as well as a direct and fair appraisal of one’s effort.

Many runners, from the everyday to the extreme, ‘religiously’ stick to their training regimes. One does not just train the body, but also the mind. In urban and secular societies in particular, running speaks to practical values and offers a socially-accepted space to test resolve and garner self-improvement. This utility could help explain running’s growing popularity amongst urban professionals in the Western world.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, people run for others. Not for their praises but for their causes. The charity sector is largely supported by marathon runners the world over. For example, last year’s london marathon saw the event record its largest amount ever raised. Rarely is a runner’s chosen charity selected arbitrarily, it is usually conflated with a deeply personal struggle. Although the money goes to an institution, it is motivated by intimate relationships and in turn this emotional talisman motivates an athlete to endure and finish a race. When we see a marathon, in a city or the icy plains of the north pole, we are literally seeing e-‘motion’ - emotional energy on the move.
