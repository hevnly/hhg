Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs. These are some of the names that formed the literary and cultural movement that was The Beat Generation. But beyond words on the page, this movement gave birth to youth culture as we know it today. Collections from all designers be they up-and-coming, avant-garde or part of the high fashion houses are being drawn towards youth culture like never before. The Beats are becoming increasingly relevant to fashion, whether they would have liked it or not.

The Beat generation were a group of writers, musicians, artists and essentially young, disenchanted and rebellious Americans who amoung other things rejected the mainstream post-war materialist culture and society. Identity was more fluidly explored through spirituality and wide-reaching liberation than by buying a big house in which to act out traditional values.

>These kids running around America in the 1950’s would lay the foundations of the hippie movement in the 60’s and eventually alter the consciousness of wider society in the Western world.

Even more ubiquitous is the less stereotyped representation of the Beat Generation style that is made up of denim jeans and shirts, ideally designed for trips along the USA’s deserted highways and the drifting lifestyles of hedonism captured in the works of Kerouac. Any vintage or thrift store with its rows and rows of Levis jeans and work shirts pays homage to the rough and ready style of the Beat Generation, epitomized in early Bob Dylan.

But now it is the ideals of the Beat Generation that seem to be returning full circle in the youth of today and also for designers. The draw of Eastern spirituality that fascinated those writers of the Fifties can be seen in one of the most exciting fashion (or anti-fashion) shows of last year, Cottweiler’s Berlin show. Easily one of London’s most exciting streetwear brands, Cottweiler paid homage to the Hare Krishnas with a pared down and ethereal show that honoured ideas of unity and the transcendent.

The Beats were in fact the original hipsters, a term coined by Norman Mailer in an essay that explored this section of the youth who ‘exist in the present, in that enormous present’ and their affiliation with the African-American culture at the time. This is another element that renders the Beats important to today, with the ubiquitous influence of African-American megastars still as relevant to culture and fashion in the forms of the Kanye’s and Beyonce’s as they were in the 50‘s with Charlie Parker and Dizzie Gillespie’s Bebop.

But more important than the appreciation of the culture was the breaking down of constricting forms of identity. The ideals of the Beats fostered unity between different races and sexualities and these fluid concepts of identity are represented more openly in fashion than many other mediums within society. In a time where these dichotomies are still being challenged, and where youth culture has never been so inspiring to fashion, the Beats causing trouble in the 1950’s are still influencing the changes, and collections, we see today.
