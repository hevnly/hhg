The arcades offered three things: cutting-edge graphics, a social experience and different ways to play. Undoubtedly the golden age of the arcade was part of an era when technology was evolving and new innovations were emerging. Even to those who experienced that era, the environment of any downtown arcade became a convenient venue for people to socialise and have fun before heading home for the night. With the accelerating advancement of technology, a change to the industry was inevitable, turning the size and expense of arcade machines into a liability rather than an advantage. Affordable, rapidly updated computers and consoles (and eventually mobile phones) first contested and then far surpassed the processing capabilities of big arcade cabinets. Swift updates in graphics, processing, storage, networking, portability, controls and screen resolutions were comfortably welcomed by the home markets. Arcade operators, tasked with changing large numbers of towering, costly systems in order to keep up of such changes, tailed off completely.

Recently there have been various attempts at sparking a kind of “arcade renaissance”, though  many of these efforts have been inconsistent due to a two decades-long gap since arcades were really a significant part of western social life. As such, it’s fair to say consumers have been sceptical about any notion of any arcade revival. That said, the Parisian based ‘Neo Legend’ is on a mission to innovate beyond just retrogaming and has the ambition to breathe new life into arcade machines. The company found and led by a team of enthusiasts in 2007 attempts to rediscover the passion for the 16-bit era of video games through a combination of diligent customization and nimble design. The machines retain the best elements of technical and visual design which vows an authentic product with a contemporary look, recapturing the nostalgia of the golden age of the Arcade. Neo Legend also offers its bespoke creations for rentals, pledging to create custom playgrounds for events and experiences, boasting a full catalog of games from classics such as Pacman and Street Fighter. Notable partners include: Palais de Tokyo, Colette and even an even a gaming zone in Orly airport terminals in France.

Neo Legend is a testament to the golden age of the arcade, extracted from original ideas and incorporating the latest technologies. While social or commercial aspects could still pull the rug out from any hope of any arcade recovery or renaissance, Neo Legend’s existence certainly permits fresh hope for new kinds of out-of-home conceptual gaming and interactive entertainment experiences.
