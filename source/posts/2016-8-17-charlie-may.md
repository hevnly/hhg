London-based womenswear designer Charlie May, accredits her ultra-minimalist aesthetic to her rural upbringing in Devon. Drawing inspirations from her surroundings and background, her signature androgynous style implements natural fibers including wools, leathers and fine silks all in subtle colours, demanding acute attention to its design and construction.

*Silk gusset shirt | Wide leg trousers*

Applying an ‘origami’ like theme to its designs of the AW16 collection, knitwear and denim remain at the helm of the garments, whilst sophisticated tailoring in pliant textures and voluminous day wear in light and heavy twills also feature. The outerwear pieces of the upcoming collection consist of natural fabrications in heavy construction.  
Stand-out garments include a woolen split kimono coat and the alpaca origami tank.
