as with his short-lived pirate station, community remains an important factor for femi and it’s one that’s played a key role in the formation of nts. through his time spent djing across the city, femi crossed paths with the likes of martelo, kutmah and moxie, now some of the station’s longest standing and most recognisable ambassadors. within the same circle, femi became involved with blaise belleville and thristian, two of the brains behind video streaming phenomenon boiler room, landing up as one of the platform’s first residents. while through regular pilgrimages down to the cavernous, now eulogized, basement of plastic people, femi encountered the trailblazing crew behind nonsense, a diverse monthly night from the likes of future radio 1 dj benji b, producer benny blanco and nts’ very own sean mcaulliffe. “i don’t think it would be where it is now if it wasn’t for the core of friends, people and djs from around here”.

within the open environs of gillett square, nts, too, forms an important component of the neighbourhood. the walk-up nature of the studio means it’s typically buzzing, inside and out, populated with the on-air dj’s entourage and any number of the station’s extended family. in theory, anyone could open the door and enter, that is before regular interruptions from some of the square’s homeless inhabitants forced them to install a deadlock. the regulars from the ethiopian coffee shop next door act “almost like security”, and on one particular occasion, when the studio door was left wide open for 3 days over christmas, they simply stood guard, chewing their omnipresent bundles of kat, and waited for someone to return. “i know if the door stays open, they’re there”

much like the shop front, what is particularly striking about nts’ digital presence is its sleek and simplistic branding. in a city effectively ruled by marketing men, where domineering screens display google weather forecasts at major roundabouts, and you’re never far from the imposing sight of canary wharf’s skyscrapers, nts opts for minimalism. widescreen, high-res and multimedia, their attractive new website, launched in august, echoes this, as does the station’s tagline, ”don’t assume”, a slogan lifted from the title of a particularly out there free jazz piece by maggie nicols and peter nu.

much of the station’s curatorial policy comes from its founder, whose own diverse taste and vast record collection spans everything from east coast hip hop and indie-grunge to new wave and j-pop. “i’ll listen to anything…music is such a bottomless pit”, says femi. it was his teenage education in the jazz and funk influenced beats of a tribe called quest and de la soul that ultimately led to what he refers to as “the dawning of my musical awakening”, realising that the foundations of so many hip hop classics heavily borrowed sounds from bygone styles. spending much of his youth boomeranging between london and lagos, the lilting sounds of king sunny ade and fela kuti were quotidian, while his uncle’s passion for prince and boy george was also influential. one night in lagos, femi recalls his mother furiously rebuking that same uncle, after he had taken his teenage nephew down to fela’s infamous shrine nightclub, a spot renowned for its lawlessness and debauchery.

>while stations such as nts reflect the local community, they are increasingly catering for a worldwide audience.

it’s an eclectic programme the likes of which fm outfits can only dream. free from the long arm of governing body ofcom, internet radio is unshackled by the regulations and licensing fees which public and commercial broadcasters must adhere to. for online stations like nts, this means both a financial break and unprecedented creative freedom. with less financial pressure, there’s less need for audio advertising and that in itself cultivates the creative output the station can facilitate. “you count up all the time that a normal radio station would have on advertising over the course of a day, that’s a lot of creative space lost”, explains sean. “not having the audio advertising and not being governed by ofcom ultimately gives us more freedom”.

although 35% of the current listenership is situated within the uk, and of that around 32% are from the capital, nts has been steadily garnering an increasingly global audience. “because of the internet, it becomes more than just a local thing…it’s a global community”, explains femi, while sean “we’ve got devout listeners in mongolia”, adds sean mcauliffe, managing director.

as digital music consumption evolves, the landscape has repeatedly changed for internet radio. streaming platforms like spotify and apple music offer free or cheap access to millions of tracks, while their complex algorithms assess your behaviours and search history in an effort to humanize the discovery process. but are these services a threat to internet stations like nts? “they’re just automated, algorithmic pieces of software that churn out songs, whilst what we’re trying to do is give people the platform in the community to go global, to create dialogue, to educate individuals, to better their lives”.

apple’s recent launch of beats 1 has changed the game once again, but femi believes this can only be a good thing for internet radio, “so long as they do it right”, insisting that “people are hungry for good content”. tune in to beats 1 today and the shows do sound clearly pre-recorded. as it stands, apple have embraced internet radio but have seemingly chosen to reject the live nature of it, arguably its most magical attribute, in place of polished, over-produced podcasts. but femi acknowledges that when a technological giant such as apple embraces something it can only be good for raising awareness. “people are like, internet radio is actually a thing now”.

indeed with nts, it seems the world is catching on. their listenership is steadily growing at around 8% every month and a chunk of that now comes from overseas, particularly with the recent launch of their second and international stream. show proposals from san francisco, texas and sydney have started piling into their inboxes, while there are also plans afoot to expand record store rotation to outfits in new york and tokyo.

more recently, the station has branched out into video content, though they are quick to point out there’s no stepping on boiler room’s toes there. “we do radio”, femi asserts, with much of the content tending to be experimental projects “working with artists in a different environment that what they’re usually in”. additionally, there’s even plans for a standalone app and a second london studio in the not too distant future. all this from a team of six full-time employees and a steady rotation of vital volunteers. 80 hour weeks are regular occurrences and as sean puts it, “it’s another level of busy”. what makes their growth and achievements all the more impressive is the fact they are yet to accept any outside capital investment. but their financial management has been sensible and while they can’t yet afford to pay the djs, they have at least been able to abolish the subs they used to charge them to play.

in essence, nts is a truly independent creative entity in an increasingly corporate industry and that must be applauded. with some of the world’s most respected artists, like juan atkins, david byrne and henry rollins, now regularly stopping by to play, its reputation is clearly speaking for itself. but how do they judge their own progress? femi believes the station is “at a good place now. we’re about to take it to this next stage”, and remains driven in creating a “global music platform that you can go on and know you’re going to find something you wouldn’t find anywhere else”. there’s certainly no sign that they’re running out of ideas, so if they can maintain that ethos of being a real discovery process for their audience, the sky really is the limit.
