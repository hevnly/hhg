Harry Seymour a freelance art historian, curator and writer constantly immersed in a buzz of projects.

Whether it’s organizing an exhibition about sexuality in Islamic culture for a counter-extremism charity or lecturing at The British Museum, the young creative combines an artist’s eye and a historian’s mind in all his work. Even contemporary culture magazines - publications rarely offering tribute to the old masters - have given Harry a platform to air his refreshing contributions. Be they about angels in Renaissance art or Goya’s portraits.

'Often people tend to think of contemporary and historical art as separate things, but there’s no reason why you can’t appreciate them as one,' says Seymour. The Moatti Gallery, that Harry manages, embodies this interplay between historical and contemporary art.

>The historian in me comes out; I try to weave a narrative into every exhibition.

Unhappy with the conceptual schism between the two, he opened the Moatti in Mayfair exhibiting pieces covering a massive temporal scale: everything from ancient Greek art and 18th Century French landscapes all the way up to contemporary works.

The young curator’s career path has always straddled both academic and creative lines. Harry began studying Fine Art at Central Saint Martins but left after finding the atmosphere too stifling and pursued a more scholastic route studying Classics and Archeology at University College London, eventually finishing with a post-grad from the Courtauld Institute in Byzantine and Islamic Art History. He has gone on to make his mark on the academic art world, managing old masters galleries and writing books on topics such as clouds in Italian painting.

Having studied the aesthetic culture of various different eras and places, he is well positioned to assess conceptions of beauty. He comes to the conclusion, however clichéd, that beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder. His own eyes light up when he talks about Byzantine wooden panels explaining that, ‘When you look at art, you have to use all five senses.’

'When you see these things today, they’re in a glass case,' he says, 'but you have to understand that this would have once been on an altar in Constantinople. You have to imagine the smell of incense and hear the hymns ringing out in the church.'

For someone so deeply immersed in the physical experience of art, it is no surprise that Harry laments the increasingly unsteady footing that art has in today’s digital world. He sees the Internet as a double-edged sword; the convenience of seeing artwork from the comfort of your phone has broadened people’s horizons, but it is also the death of looking at art. With a sense of foreboding, he talks about apps that are being developed for museums offering the viewer pages of text about the work in front of them. 'The idea of walking into The National Gallery and everyone staring at their phones is my worst nightmare.'

He would rather see people investing efforts in developing online platforms for unknown artists where curators can discover them. ‘This is the biggest issue in the art industry for a young curator. As soon as someone finds a solution it will change the face of the industry entirely.’
