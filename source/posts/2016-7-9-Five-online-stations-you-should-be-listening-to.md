With the advent of music services like Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal listening to the radio has an almost nostalgic feel. It’s certainly a more intimate experience than the music recommendation algorithms used buy the likes of existing streaming services. Music curated by humans, being listened to by humans from all over the world (Although this dynamic is finding its footing on these platforms also with the likes of Beats 1).

Away from these monoliths, smaller niche online radio stations have been forging ahead with great content to suit your every mood.

Founded by Chimurenga in collaboration with musician and composer Neo Muyanga in 2008, the Pan African Space Station (PASS) – is a periodic, pop-up live radio studio; a performance and exhibition space; a research platform and living archive, as well as an ongoing, internet based radio station.
PASS is a machine for travelling at the speed of thought – it borrows its slogan “There are other worlds out there they never told you about” from the philosopher, composer and bandleader Sun Ra. PASS seeks to challenge the concepts of contemporary African music and to excite new transitory and transient communities with each journey, bringing focus to collective experience and targeting an investigation into how we locate ourselves and how we communicate our human and historic cultures.
