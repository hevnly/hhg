LN-CC (Late Night Chameleon Cafe in full) is probably the only retail space in the world that has had Björk knocking on all the surrounding doors trying to find the entrance. Following a relaunch in May this year the unique space and approach to fashion and lifestyle is even more striking than ever.

Since it’s inception in 2010, LN-CC’s concept store has been focused meticulously around its beautifully crafted space and a sense of curation; be this in fashion, accessories, books or music. Originally designed by Gary Card in 2011, the interior has since been updated; the former wooden clad interior has been usurped by a sharper, monochromatic and futuristic look, influenced by aspects of Japanese culture admired by the buyers and curators at LN-CC. Accessed via a nondescript office block door on Dalston’s Shacklewell lane, once buzzed in, you are warped into a tesseract-like dimension, acutely designed to stimulate your senses. Immediately, the mesmerising ultra-white of card’s perspex, hexagonal hallway implies that you are no longer on earth and perhaps on the cusp of a first encounter with an alien species. each room in the space has been cleverly arranged and designed to play subtle tricks on the mind through the ingenious use of mirrors and lighting, to create an exploratory shopping experience unlike any other.

>The musical variety mirrors the array of carefully curated fashion, accessories, music and books

Acoustically, the store’s soundtrack accurately sets the mood with an eclectic mix of curated playlists. The musical variety mirrors the array of carefully curated fashion, accessories, music and books. one room in particular illustrates how the physical store acts as a cherry-picking of the wider selection on the online store. Each piece is displayed in otherworldly, geometric structures by artist Alberto Biagetti. A sofa seemingly inspired by lunar rocks reenforces the feeling that LN-CC is lightyears away from the ever-busy center of Dalston. Playing host to international designers such as Raf Simons and eponymous east London based labels such as Yang Li, Christopher Kane and J.W.Anderson proves that LN-CC is very much at the centre of London’s fashion galaxy.

Also on offer at LN-CC is a selection of rare books and vinyl records. Continuing in the spirit of curation, these are organised and selected by tastemakers such as musician Johnny Nash, and Conor Donlon of Donlon books. Beautifully rare second-hand records and books hand-sourced directly from Japan are also available. Guests are inspired to sample the records on a dedicated record player and flick through the assortment of books, providing the right balance of lifestyle and fashion that is all too often off the mark.

>This awareness of the importance of sustainability extends to their selection of labels

An event space, hidden behind a labyrinth of walkways at the rear of the store, further elevates LN-CC beyond a concept store. Complete with a brand-new Mickey Bulver sound-system, the space has seen private functions from record labels such as 4AD and XL and parties where the who’s who of fashion and music clink champagne flutes. A dimly lit bar area stocks an arsenal of artisanal alcoholic weaponry; sea-water infused Spanish beers, natural sulphate free wines and belu water (a company that donates 100% of its profits to water aid).

This represents an impressive attention to detail but also what LN-CC describes as being ‘conscious’. This awareness of the grave importance of sustainability is apparent throughout the store’s selection of labels that make a concerted effort to combine the highest quality with an element of sustainability. An ethos that is highlighted both online and in store. for example, LN-CC’s mesmerising hallway commands greater value when one learns that it is crafted of recycled perspex and re-blown blackened glass.

The LN-CC does so much, but in being so carefully and passionately arranged, no element ever overbears another. With such an accomplished reopening you can be sure Björk won’t be the only one knocking.
