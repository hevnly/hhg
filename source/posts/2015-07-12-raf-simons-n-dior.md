Without much more than a wave, a kiss and a humble nod to his adoring audience, Raf Simons took his final walk as the creative director of Christian Dior at the end of its women’s Spring/Summer 2016 show. This fall, generating even more buzz than he did in April 2012 as he took over the french house, it was announced that he would not be renewing his contract with the LVMH holding. A resolution made by Simons, was bittersweetly supported by Sidney Toledano, chief executive officer of Christian Dior and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH.

“It is a decision, based entirely and equally on my desire to focus on other interests in my life, including my own brand, and the passions that drive me outside of my work,” Simons said in an official statement on his departure. “Christian Dior is an extraordinary company, and it has been an immense privilege to be allowed to write a few pages of this magnificent book.”

While Simons penned far fewer pages than his predecessor, John Galliano who held the position for 15 years, it is arguable that Simons work held greater meaning for the label as it moves forward into its story. Over the three and a half years under his guidance, of Simons’ most substantial contribution to the brand, was giving it a sense of modernity. Keeping in line the fundamental Dior codes—extravagance, romantic, and a feminine silhouette—he achieved a reinterpretation singularly his own. “I want to have quite a radical approach to modernizing it,” he said in Frederic Tchengs' 2014 documentary “Dior and I”.

Full, billowing and luscious shirts, slit with playful pockets. Statuesque dresses draped over tailored trousers. Strong, structured suit jackets, tapered at the wait. And delicate floral patterns interspersed with beautifully jaring graphics. This marriage of Simons’ often realist and minimalist labeled aesthetic and the Dior foundations proved to bear more than just a new vision and lifeblood to the brand but with it an increase in sales. In the recent fiscal year, revenues in couture alone rose 18 percent to $1.94 billion and all throughout his tenure, a cumulative 60-percent growth was reported.

“I have asked myself repeatedly why I started in fashion,” Simons begins to divulge in an interview with Another Magazine. “It always comes down to the first fashion show I saw in 1990, when I saw Martin [Margiela’s] third collection, ‘The White Collection’. That was the moment when I understood what fashion could be."

>White is pure and simple and matches with everything. Dior

Often at the end of things, people reflect upon the beginning. For so many who recognized Simons only as his eponymous menswear label, the undertaking of such an embellished and effeminate brand was a departure. A far cry from his first show however, through 18 collections in both ready-to-wear and haute couture—with his last presented under a vision of half a million lilac delphiniums at the Louvre—Simons, with a last wave, kiss, and humble nod demonstrated to the world, in his own right, what fashion could be.
