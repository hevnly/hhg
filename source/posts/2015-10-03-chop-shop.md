chop shop lies in london's bustling west end, a restaurant as refined and fun as its surroundings. it's one of the latest from the nyc-based altamarea group, a company with a pedigree in innovative dining concepts. opening up in the wake of haymarket's exciting redevelopment, its cutting-edge new venture fits in well.

the faintly blue-lit, stripped-back interior creates a serene but stimulating ambience, with bare-brick walls, dusky wood-panelled floors and smatterings of checkerboard tiling. exposed air vents and metallic lamps lend an industrial air, which is offset tastefully by large antique wall-tiles. wine and spirits are stacked to the ceiling above the bar, from where the cocktails busily flow, including the signature 'haymarket'. this tribute to chop shop's home comes in the form of a heady blend of bourbon and vermouth, and it's a great accompaniment to the restaurant's atmosphere.

> where others would fear to tread, the chefs at chop shop have boldly reimagined the classics

it's easy to detect chop shop's roots in their take on british dishes. where others would fear to tread, the chefs at chop shop have boldly reimagined the classics, and this is particularly noticeable in the starter menu. the sausage roll is made with mouthwatering pulled-pork and served with a bacon relish, a maximizing touch that's quintessentially american. strong italian- american influences are evident in the gnocchi-based 'cottage pasta pie', the salami cold-cut plank – including a fennel-infused finocchiona – and the 'cotechino' scotch egg, served hot with the egg poached perfectly inside. but the menu is not only for meat-eaters; the tomato and herb romaine-lettuce salad with the special chop-shop vinaigrette stands proud among the other starters.

when it comes to the main courses, the menu reads like so many great reasons to return. these include the middle white pork loin, served with the crackling at its rich, brittle best, and the exquisite oven-roasted cumbrian chicken. but the crown of the mains is the fillet steak, aged for 35 days and charred perfectly to enliven the tender, crimson beef. compliment this with a red wine bone marrow sauce or experience a tasty chop shop quirk, the peppercorn sauce with vodka and bacon; either way, it's an unbeatable steak dinner.

the convivial mood is best enjoyed when the food is shared. the highlight of the sharing options is the 12 hour usda short-rib for two, with an accompanying tart apple and radish slaw that invigorates the bite-sized slices of prime beef. guests can share this with an off-beat range of 'toppers' and sides, with cheesy leeks and a whole roasted garlic available alongside chips and sautéed spinach.

dessert brings more innovative culinary delights, by now an expectation, not a surprise. the brownie sundae will gratify any sweet-tooth, with the fudgy brownie swimming in warm peanut-butter. a recommendable accomplice is 'the godfather', a bourbon and saliza amaretto blend that harmonizes well with the sweetness of the sundae. for a lighter, pick-me-up end to the meal, the affogato goes down brilliantly; for pure indulgence, the smooth butterscotch custard crunches with shortbread cookies.

> being relevant in the west-end means staying fresh, and chop shop do exactly that

being relevant in the west-end means staying fresh, and chop shop do exactly that. exciting plans for the future include 'suckling pig sundays'; starting from early september, parties of up to 50 will be welcomed in the roomy basement with a cocktail and canape reception. afterwards, they're treated to a whole roast suckling pig. it promises to be quite an evening, if the quality of their menu is anything to go by.

the restaurant is sure to become a mainstay of the west end. it attracts residents and tourists alike with its typically british emphasis on well-sourced beef, but provides something of the unexpected and contemporary too, making it perfect for the mercurial area.
