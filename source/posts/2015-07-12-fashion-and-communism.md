Communist revolutionaries, dictators, and regimes may seem like a strange influence for fashion. And yet the iconic status that certain figures achieved (for good and for bad) and certain aspects of state-controlled style, have undeniably found their way into what we wear today.

When looking at how revolutionaries have affected fashion you almost have to start with that image of Che Guevara. Known as ‘Guerrillero Heroico’, the original photo was taken by Cuban fashion photographer Alberto Korda in 1960. By the end of the 1960’s this image, as a result Guevara’s actions as a Marxist revolutionary in Cuba and eventual execution, had become a cultural phenomenon that is still seen on the t-shirts of western teenagers. Now other labels are harnessing the power of Guevara’s cultural influence. Belstaff’s Roadmaster Wax Jacket is described by them as a descendent from their early wax jackets, one of which was owned by none other than Che Guevara himself for his travels in South America. Whilst the Guevara t-shirt might be more market-stall bargain than collectors item, there can be no doubt that the image remains in the mainstream.

And yet, there are layers of irony to this success. Che Guevara now world famous not for his Marxist ideals (or his well-reported ruthlessness and brutality) but from being on t-shirts sold in the Capitalist system he sought to overthrow. Other influences of communism on fashion border on the insensitive, as with the ‘Mao Collar’. This style, normally known as the Mandarin Collar, has also found its way into all levels of fashion from Givenchy (who use the term Mandarin Collar) to Zara (who call it the Mao Collar). Relating a style of collar to Mao Zedong, a dictator and the cause of up to 70 million deaths (by some estimations), seems to be exploiting a very different form of notoriety.

However, the work of one of menswear’s most exciting designers, Russia’s Gosha Rubchinskiy, shows the potential of exploring his own country’s recent history. The Spring/Summer 2016 collection is a celebration of 1980’s Soviet style that has resurged in popularity with today’s Russian youths. The Paris preview saw young male models from Moscow clad in gaudy coloured Soviet sportswear. Prints in the collection recall the works of Russian artist Alexander Rodchenko, who’s influential use of bold colours and geometric simplicity can be seen in almost any soviet era propaganda poster. The hammer and sickle were even shaved into the head of one model whilst another carried huge white replicas of the Soviet symbol.

This collection pays testament to a younger generation re-appropriating earlier styles and taking them forward, making them their own. Gosha Rubchinskiy is at once altering old associations whilst bringing them back into the spotlight. This emerges in the motif of “1984” appearing throughout the collection. Alluding to George Orwell’s dystopian novel blurs the lines between simple celebration and showing an awareness of more troubling aspects of Russia’s Soviet history. Here is a celebration of fashion and culture that goes deeper than sales in a collection playfully ironic and critical, whilst aesthetically fresh and bold. It is a celebration that calls us to not just wear  the past on t-shirts but to actually consider it as a way of informing our present.
