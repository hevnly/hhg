Always daring and never disappointing, season after season, Casely-Hayford has continued to embody everything necessary in contemporary menswear; wearable charm complimented by a healthy dose of flair. In particular, the eponymous label's AW16 collection is both bold and refined, pacing confidently along the proverbial avenue that divides Saville Row and Dover street. Retaining their acute Britishness, the father-son design duo that is Joe & Charlie Casely-Hayford has again served up an avant-garde collection that is comfortably at home both on the catwalk and in the streets.

Though the entire collection is strong, the outerwear pieces in particular stand out for their bold militaristic aesthetic, carrying with them a certain air of regality. Their imposing silhouettes and 'loudness' is artistically and skilfully softened with subtle finesse. In this editorial, hevnly invades the Queen's backyard of Belgravia in a nod to the sophisticated rule-breaking synonymous with the Casely-Hayford label.
