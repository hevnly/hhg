For the past three decades Japanese fashion brand TOMORROWLAND has successfully directed a fiercely competitive and highly sophisticated retail market. Under the helm of Hiroyuki Sasaki, it made its name and built its prestige on an ability to modify the western trends of Paris and Milan to the Japanese body shape and taste, always making sure a sense of sophistication and subtlety was retained. They are one of those by today’s standard, uniquely fastidious brands who pay as much attention to the stitch on the buttons, as to the cut on the lapel on a blazer or the length on the hand. Always sophisticated and always perfected, the design aesthetic is based on authenticity, wearable anytime, anywhere.

TOMORROWLAND is widely renowned for, seamlessly merging contemporary silhouettes and high quality fabrics. At the center stage of its upcoming autumn/winter collection, diligently tailored street-style garments polished off with a subtle touch of detailed cuts. Versatility plays a key role in this chameleonic collection, the colour story boasts a clever combination of dark and earthy colours, simultaneously presenting a vast array of hues, tones and shades. Malleable fabrics combine to shape the silhouettes of the pieces, where drawstring trousers and oversized knits have been tailored to be shapeless, creating a slack fit. Woolen coats, parkas and bombers are some of the featured outerwear pieces, in which have been designed to provide sufficient room for multiple layering, granting the looks in the collection further dimensions.
