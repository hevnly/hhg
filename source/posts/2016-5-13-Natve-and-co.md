Streams of pale, untainted wood flood the room with a quiet and peaceful energy, an effortless blend with drops of slate grey and dynamic copper. Standing behind the counter, with a pot of green tea brewing in a smooth, charcoal, ceramic pot is Sharon Jo-Yun Hung, founder of Native & Co.

As the tea is poured, the clean lines that have been so carefully established in the shop lead the eye around as if on tram lines. The delicious juxtaposition of smooth wooden surfaces against chiseled or hammered ceramics; of cool, off whites punctuated by minimal patterns, this instills an intoxicating sense of calm and is what has come to be synonymous with Native & Co.

*Traditional craft products reinterpreted for contemporary life.*

When the pair set out on their journey in 2014, after graduating in 3D Product Design from Central St. Martins and launching Native & Co at the London Design Festival, they wanted to challenge the notion that Japanese shops and crafts were moody and mysterious. Throwing light on their native traditions, Native & Co have – seemingly effortlessly – created an environment that feels comfortable, easy and peaceful. ‘We were worried about it being too intimidating. We didn’t want it to feel like a gallery,’ Sharon shares. ‘We want our shop to compliment our crafts but in a new context.’

It is this idea of evolving their traditions to a place the Western world can access that makes Native & Co so intriguing. ‘Japanese design is more purpose driven, which can make traditional crafts seem quite distant,’ Chris Yoshiro-Green, founder, explains. The eye wanders again over the products and imagination takes over. Silently, the mind finds each piece a place and a use in the home with surprising ease, scenarios are created whereby it becomes impossible to imagine managing without them. Loved ones and family are assigned them as gifts. Selecting such a diverse yet harmonious range is a skill and one that is standing Native & Co in very good stead.

As designers, both Sharon Ju-Yun Hung and Chris Yoshiro-Green have a desire to create something emotive. It is a thread, woven so intrinsically in every decision they make it is inescapable. As the tea is sipped, they talk about their design process and about their forthcoming Homewear collection. ‘For us, it is more about appreciating the materials. The material comes first, then the form follows. We choose the material so it reflects us, it feels like us.’ This isn’t the traditional Japanese way and again highlights how the pair are transcending and evolving their cultural boundaries. Traditionally, Japanese designers utilise an abundance of regional materials, their designs follow a generational trend which can make them formulaic and predictable. This order and hierarchy that is ever present in traditional Japanese designs is not lost but redefined in Native & Co’s fresh fluidity and clean lines.

But the pair do not shun their traditions, far from it. They honour the parts they feel a close affinity to - simplicity. Sometimes, simplicity can be over looked, Jo-Yun Hung quietly muses. ‘Lots of products in the UK and Europe have a USP. Lots of people are looking for something odd or unusual. There is nothing extraordinary in the shape or form of our products. Our products are there to present the material they are made from.’ And that in itself is their USP. ‘There is a hierarchy of wood in the Western World, and this can dictate how you perceive the product. We are very concerned that the focus be on the beauty of what the product is.

*Native & Co focuses on pieces that combine function with traditional materials.*

Maintaining this vision was a priority for the pair at the start of their business journey. Jo-Yun Hung and Yoshiro-Green proceeded with clear and definite ideas of what they wanted Native & Co to be and what they wanted to represent. Over time, Yoshiro-Green reflects that they are no longer so strict. ‘We’ve learnt from our mistakes and have learnt to be more fluid. It’s also about what people choose.’ Opening their minds to slight deviations from the original concept and allowing themselves to evolve with their brand has enabled Native & Co to help forget the rigidity of their traditions and truly blend the East and the West in a new and refreshing light.
