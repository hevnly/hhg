Hevnly Looks at some of the most stylish people of the 1980's.

## David Bowie

As he developed as an artist so did his style, he moved quickly from the zany outfits of his alter ego Ziggy Stardust into tailored suits and was one of the first artists to shift his image with the era.

## Grace Jones

Her iconic style still feels modern and cutting edge. Angular hair, bold makeup and larger than life stage costumes were pioneered by Grace long before figures like Lady GaGa.

## Don Johnson

This man, or perhaps more accurately his character in Miami Vice arguably had the biggest impact on style in the 80's.
Pastals on pastals, t-shirts under double-breasted linen suits and of course huge reflective Aviators.

## Michael Jackson

The king of pop was undoubtedly the king of style also. From red leather jackets to bedazzled gloves every video seemed to usher in a new iconic look.
