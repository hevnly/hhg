A young consultant was waiting for her friend to arrive for dinner when her phone died. She was angry: how would she occupy her time without her smartphone to check emails, scroll through instagram and keep up with the news.

But in the two hours she waited for her friend to arrive, unconnected and alone, she realised her dependance on her phone was making her unhappy. The next day, she went into work and told her boss she would be going offline for two weeks, and found her focus and productivity was significantly heightened.

>Technology to make you feel better

Meet Kate Unsworth, founder of smart jewellery company, Vinaya. Paradoxically, it was this two week digital detox in 2013 that inspired her to found a tech company.

Unusually for a tech company, Vinaya’s aim is to reduce the amount of time people spend with eyes lowered to their phone, obsessively refreshing their twitter feed. Their smart jewellery is designed to help wearers take control of their relationship with technology, put their phone down, and focus on their present situation.

Their Altruis jewellery range melds cutting edge technology with impeccable design. Each item in the small collection is strikingly minimalist, which belies the complex engineering behind them. The zirconia ceramic stone in every piece encases the very latest Bluetooth technology. The smart jewellery can be synced with an iOS app to let off small vibrations when the phone receives calls and messages.

Initially, this seems to stand in exact opposition to Unsworth’s founding inspiration of a digital detox. However, Vinaya’s Altruis app allows you to filter who you want to receive a notification from; Unsworth herself only receives an alert whenever either of her founding partners try to contact her.

She hopes that people who use her smart jewellery will be able to leave their phone in their bag and connect with the present, safe in the knowledge that if something urgent happens they will receive a discreet vibration from their wearable.

She encourages people to find a balance between connected and disconnected states.

The name ‘Vinaya’ derives from Buddhist terminology that Unsworth learned on her travels in India. Among other things it can mean discipline or tranquility, and conveys the buddhist teaching of evolving with the time without losing sight of the core human truths. It is this final sense of the word that Unsworth found particularly resonant.

The importance Unsworth places on discipline and learning can be seen in the very way she has structured her company. Vinaya does not just concern itself with glamorizing existing technology but places a huge emphasis on seeking insight and understanding into how technology can be harnessed to make our lives better.

Their Shoreditch base is broadly split into two sections: the lab and the studio. The former houses a select group of neuroscientists and anthropologists, who spend their days researching human behaviours in relation to technology. The latter is the home of a team of designers, who are always looking for new ways to transform these findings into life enhancing products.

Like many of us, Kate Unsworth is seeking balance and tranquility, and hopes that her new generation of wearables will help others in this struggle too.
