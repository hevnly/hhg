## Purple Noon

This René Clément Film showcased classic american style - costume designer Bella Clément put together stunningly elegant looks that were imbued with a sense of rebellion by Alain Delon. His first appearence in a light blue oxford button-down shirt, off-white jeans and brown suede horsebit loafers works perfectly with the Italian landscape of azure seas, waterfronts and picturesque coastal villages.

*Purple Noon - loosely based on the 1955 novel The Talented Mr. Ripley by Patricia Highsmith*


## Easy Rider

A film that became a symbol of American counterculture and outlaw spirt trod a fine line between iconic and ironic from gaudy stars and stripes to native american inspired biker jackets. Easy Rider was the classic road film.

*Easy Rider - written by Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Terry Southern*


## North By Northwest

The style of this American Action Thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock is best summed up by a quote from Eva Marie Saint “Hitchcock made everybody in the picture dress in a classic style… He didn’t want the picture to date because of the clothes. There’s not one outfit I couldn’t wear today with a few minor adjustments and not look stylish.”

*North by Northwest is now regarded among the essential Hitchcock pictures and is often listed as one of the greatest films of all time.*


## La Haine

A movie that came before the boom in street fashion and in many ways ushered it in! Although the film is now 20 years old it still feels burningly relevant, with its stark message on race and class. La Haine often captures a clash between parisian cultures through the clothing worn by the characters, and has a deep anti luxury aesthetic that can be seen reflected on the runways of today.

*The title derives from a line spoken by one of them, Hubert, "La haine attire la haine!", "hatred breeds hatred."*


## Do The Right Thing

This films explosive mix of comedy, drama and racial politics was called culturally significant by the Library Of Congress for a reason. Spike Lee's powerful film has attained an almost cult like status that can in part be attributed to the films iconic aesthetic. Spike Lee noted in the films journal that “the look of the film should be bright… almost blinding AFROCENTRIC bright!”

*The title comes from the famous Malcolm X quote, "You've got to do the right thing."*


## Reservoir Dogs

This film created some of the most iconic style moments of the 90's and redefined the gangster silhouette. Tarantino’s film made lounge suits and skinny ties iconic.
