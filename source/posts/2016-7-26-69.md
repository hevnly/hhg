Fashion has a fairly rich history of experimenting with, and even embracing androgyny. ‘Accessibility’ and ‘gender fluidity’, these are two fundamental philosophies of the anonymous, non-gendered, non-demographic brand 69. The Los Angeles based label is indicative  of the surge of a new anti-fashion sentiment, which isn’t so much defiant as it is simply ambiguous. Identifying as “Non-Fashion”, 69 opts to ignore the conventional in favour of an independent, romanticised vision of clothing, community, consumption and creativity. Described as a lifestyle brand, comfort and practicality are at the helm of its designs. “Its vision is largely about comfort and being for everyone.” declares 69’s designer, who from the genesis of its creation has elected to remain anonymous. This is evident through the brand’s offering - denim, having historic links to the working class and embodying one of the most durable, comfortable fabrics available.

Comparable to the ‘BLACK COMME des GARÇONS’ line, none of 69’s garments are made with a target consumer in mind. The oversized designs permit freedom of movement and at its core 69 is wholly inclusive, providing denim garments which are both timeless and yet crafted in our present but meant for the future.
