It is without a doubt that the idea of workwear has evolved throughout the last century. While this is partly due to the constant evolution of clothing and the introduction of new styles and products, it has just as much to do with the changes in the types of work that currently exist into today's world. From the primary industries of farming to manufacturing, transcending to more business orientated positions, the associated garments of each respective workforce has undergone notable transformations causing some designers to engender an entirely new approach to making clothing.

*The TEÄTORA 'Gear Wear' serves to optimise modern lifestyle and enhance creative performance.*



Since 2013, Japanese workwear brand TEÄTORA has been maintaining its concept which sees workwear take an entirely new mould and highlight the significance of clothing in the working environment. Aspiring to create practical garments that have been equipped with a ‘conscience’, while retaining a basic structure of design. Offering ’functional clothing’ intended to enhance the performance of the 'urban creator', the TEÄTORA collection is designed  to develop functional solutions for the urban environment.

*The Easy roll one-day t-shirt |*



By developing the most optimal ‘feature clothing’ possible for the modern day creator, designer Daisuke Kamide has the strong philosophy of designing garments that meet the needs of different working environments. By rethinking, refining and introducing designs which run behind a comprehensive design system for three different types of worker - creators, travellers and nomad workers - the garments aim to make travel packing simple, sitting in a chair for prolonged periods of time easier and making daily commutes more bearable. With portability, comfort and travel at the heart of its design philosophy, each piece in the collection is practical yet sophisticated. Notably, the packable blazers in technical nylon construction and easy roll one-day tees encapsulate their no-nonsense approach to function and style.          

At first sighting, the TEÄTORA design offers seemingly complex philosophies, yet brilliantly executes these ideas. Through redesigning the concept of garments, researching the environments of modern day workers and reimagining the relationship between the human body and clothing, the output is a design which is simple yet elegant and undoubtably utilitarian.
