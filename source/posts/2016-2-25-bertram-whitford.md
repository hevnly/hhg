Bertram Whitford creates furniture for individuals. Based around their style, their environment and their needs, his design is truly bespoke.

The London-based designer operates out of his workshop on the Thames river. He has made a tremendous range of pieces: from console tables to magazine racks, from photo and map mounts to maple desks. And the list goes on: a biltong dryer, a copper and oak cabinet, a mother of pearl bookcase, even a series coffee tables designed around discarded vacuum cleaner hoses.

>One of the difficult things about being a maker is that most of my mistakes are from things like turning around too quickly.

Bertram’s creations often have serendipitous beginnings. A clock for example: it began as just a few off-cuts of wood lying around the workshop. ‘I was about to throw them away. But then I spent some time arranging them to get an idea of what they might be.’ Once the clock was in his mind, the more technical aspects followed. ‘You think, how do I realise that into a functioning clock? How is the mechanism going to be housed?’   

Other pieces have followed similar paths. Once, for example, Bertram came across some worm-eaten wood. It seemed unusable; but with a little ingenuity an accident can quickly become a feature. ‘I planed the timber down. And then suddenly instead of holes you see the pathways that the worms have made through the wood. It’s quite beautiful.’ He filled these pathways with copper and continued to add other elements of copper to make them more pronounced. 

The holes, then, added a new element. Like the cracks in Marcel Duchamp’s, The Large Glass, chance was incorporated into the design: it was a simple gift of fate. It isn’t always so easy, though. Sometimes there are no alternatives; and then it’s back to the drawing board. 

Bertram had always enjoyed working with his hands. He used to design his own album covers for bands that didn’t exist, for music that had never been played. He resolved finally—after a period of teaching English as a Foreign Language—to become a maker, and in 2010 he completed his training in the traditional methods of cabinet making. 

But Bertram owes a lot of his learning to other resources: books, museums, and YouTube. ‘YouTube is unbelievable. Coupled with things like eBay and you can get going straight away. There’s a beauty in that. Unlike in the past: anybody can do it now.’ 

Bertram’s pieces are highly acclaimed and proving popular. His works consistently feature intricate details, delicate inlays and fine finishing. But there is something about his work that separates him from other furniture designers.

‘I’m more interested in architectural or natural designs. Rolling hills, waves. I like that kind of organic fluency, and I find a lot of curves within my work. A lot of it is about getting the ratio right.’ 

In 2012 he appeared on the BBC show Handmade Revolution, where his entry was named the judges’ favourite; after the show it was exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. He had created a contemporary reworking of a bonheur du jour, a small desk popular in 18th century Paris. It combines a variety of woods: maple, sycamore, American black walnut, burr ash and poplar cluster; and it unites traditional methods of cabinetmaking with a modern style. 

Is what he creates art? ‘I don’t consider myself an artist. I’m a maker, first and foremost.’ Ultimately, though, labels don’t matter much to Bertram: ‘For me, it’s about the making. It’s the process that’s exciting.’ And his creations speak for themselves.
