'Our motivation isn't to make products that resonate with the luxury fashion consumer. But the nature of what we do, the design and the inspiration, I think sometimes makes it part of that world,' claims Nike’s CEO, Mark Parker, when asked about his company’s growing share in the luxury sportswear market.

Despite Parker’s former statement, Nike clearly look to further their connection with the luxury retail market. Collaborations with designers and celebrities from Michael Jordan to Kanye West, Chitose Abe (sacai) to Errolson Hugh (ACG) have substantially helped sportswear out the gym and onto the catwalk.

The active sports category is the fastest-growing segment of the retail market and has designers itching to collaborate with influential sportswear companies. Trend forecaster, Sheila Aimette, shares some enlightening words on the subject:

‘I see many designers themselves wear the more directional sneakers and want to be part of these limited, high-end collaborations because it speaks to their own sensibilities. By pairing with these classic active brands, designers have almost a sure-fire way to reach consumers that are part of that world, and also introduce new consumers to their brand.’

>Tights are the new denim. We have seen that women interact more seamlessly across running, workout, fitness and lifestyle. We see all those things blend.

In 2015 Nike’s President, Trevor Edwards, expressed the company’s commitment to a female audience, to whom he attributes the development of the sportswear fashion trend.

Historically, sportswear as fashion was intended for ‘ladies of leisure’. Furthermore, the first sportswear-fashion designers - working almost 100 years ago now - were themselves women. Nike’s collaboration with Acronym’s Johanna F. Schneider (NikeLab x JFS) sees them staying true to this vision and has resulted in a modular collection featuring outfits that build, layer by layer for different stages of a workout, including the transitional periods before and after.

The western world has recently seen an explosion of ‘activewear’ into everyday fashion; whether you exercise or not. The trend is developing substantially amongst urbanites and makes sense against their social backdrop.

As a result of the dominant well-being and healthy-living narratives in this sector, there is increasing demand for running shoes, gym memberships and yoga classes. For those wishing to stay fit in a world where work is plentiful and time short, compromises are inevitable. The pace and constraints of city life have demanded that once separated uniforms of work and exercise converge into one seamless style.

Nike’s global reputation makes them a first-line respondent to this demand. Their forthcoming collaboration with Givenchy's Riccardo Tisci (who re-visited the iconic ‘Nike Air Force 1’ shoe in 2014) is currently shrouded in secrecy but will undoubtedly impact high street strollers and track sprinters alike.

Love it or loathe it - as this all-purpose clothing becoming more fashionable, more comfortable and more versatile by the day - the world of activewear and sports fashion is only just warming up.
