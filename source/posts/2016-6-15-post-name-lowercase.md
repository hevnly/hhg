Art Comes First is the creative collective from Sam Lambert and Shaka Maidoh that is changing the face of contemporary tailoring. Utilising a dynamic approach to collaboration and merging influences that range from nearby Saville Row to the African sartorial tradition, ACF are truly reinvigorating ideas of style and grooming for the modern man.

The pair have begun by building on a rich heritage. Lambert was born in Angola before growing up between Spain and the UK. His father was a tailor and he still remembers his first bespoke suit, given to him at the age of five. Shaka Maidoh’s father was a sartor from West Africa and this early influence has filtered into the sharp cuts they produce today. The influences of vintage emerge in the robust fabrics and bold detail that is reminiscent of the portraits of Malian photographers Malick Sidibé and Seydou Keïta. Their work showed the world a new side to African style which has been picked up in the traditionally inflected styles of some of ACF’s finest pieces. Few designers could bring double-breasted jackets  so effortlessly into the contemporary closet but through a close attention to form that draws on vintage, Lambert and Maidoh are able to do just that.

But to focus on one influence would not do ACF justice. Ideas of the gypsy and a nomadic existence filter through all their creations; their main line ‘Avec Ces Freres’ represents ‘Travelling tailoring by travelling tailors’. And they are collectors and curators as much as they are designers, piecing together the influences they discover along the way allowing this experience to emerge in all facets of their work, be it styling, photography or design. This freedom and focus on eclectic experience perfectly mirrors a changing lifestyle, where the world has never been so accessible and experience so open to novelty. It is this, as much as the bold motifs resonant in their work, that could be labelled punk - a rebellious freedom of influence and expression but always balanced with sartorial dexterity.

Collaboration is also key for Art Comes First. Capsule collections with brands such as PONY and collaborative efforts for trade shows, including Pitti Uomo, develop this exploratory ethos. Conceptual processes that work with other art forms are also experimented with as seen with ‘The DJ Project’ where vintage pieces were deconstructed and mixed with a contemporary edge, to reflect the midas touch of a skilled DJ, forming gold from a mix of old and new. This alchemical approach is prevalent through all their work, bringing together disparate elements to create something else entirely. The COAL project brought together of seven creatives from wide-ranging disciplines that included leather goods, hat and eyewear specialists but also a poet and, of course, Lambert and Maidoh themselves. This project perfectly bound concepts of function and style and was presented in a suitcase holding all the essentials: eyewear, a hat, a shirt, a tie, a pair of shoes, socks and a scrapbook; all unified by the colour black.

Art Comes First approach everything they do with a receptivity second to none. With this untethered approach to both life and creativity, they will no doubt continue to refine our tastes and style for some time to come.
