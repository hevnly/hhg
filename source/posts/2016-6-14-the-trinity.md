In the second half of the 20th Century, three figures changed the state of fashion in a way more radical than had ever been seen before. These three designers are of course; Issey Miyake, Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yammamoto.

Emerging from a Japanese society experiencing economic boom and unrivaled technological development, these three channelled both traditional culture and the rapidly changing social landscape of Japan to create designs that would shock and then reinvigorate the high fashion of the western world.

*The inspirational Miyake, Yamamoto and Kawakubo have influenced a generation of designers and artists alike*

Issey Miyake has been heralded as starting this movement, after living in Paris and New York he returned to Japan in the 1970’s where he explored the new potential of fabric through technological development. Diffusing labels of “East” and “West”, Miyake broke down conventions of fashion by focusing his attention on the interaction between body and material, breaking down the rigidity of fashions rules through the deconstruction of conventional fits. By the 1980’s Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yammamoto, building on Miyake’s legacy, took his ideas to further upend outdated western conceptions of fashion. This became manifest in minimalist, mostly black, but always monochrome, palettes and voluminous loose fits. Traditional eastern details such as wide sleeves were met with a penchant for asymmetry. Detail, if present, was constantly reinterpreted by being distressed, crushed, over-sized; the list goes on. The designs could look unfinished and broke down notions of beauty and gender to push the potential of what we wear to its limits.

If this all sounds familiar it is because the legacy of these designers has gradually filtered down through the positions of anti-fashion, or postmodern fashion, to heavily influencing the world’s designers today - and now even the high-street. Their influence consistently returns, showing the all encompassing power of their innovation. Kawakubo personally nurtured the development of some of the next generations of Japan’s designers such as Jun Watanabe. The Antwerp Six, another Tribe in this issue, expressly stated the influence of the Japanese avant-garde, and it is not hard to see the influence in so many of todays avant-garde designers from Damir Doma to Rick Owens. They also added much eastern character to the western fashion lexicon. Fine silks with woven nature motifs are one example, but also the general move away from the geometric, archaic couture cuts are still present in todays fashion designers.

And this influence on western fashion stretches further than the catwalk to truly influence our interaction with fashion and clothes in the everyday. Issey Miyake’s Pleats style is truly unique and beautiful in its airy, delicate and fluid manifestation of fit and is being replicated in luxury retail like never before. Rei Kawakubo’s Comme des Garçons Play with its iconic heart shaped logo is one of street-styles most ubiquitous features, while Yohji Yammamoto’s diffusion label with Adidas, Y-3, has been exploring technical fabrics and the relationship between high-fashion and sportswear long before the indomitable rise of the style in recent years.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, these designers changed the very way we conceive of fashion. Breaking down sexualised notions of beauty by focusing on abstract expression and notions of fit and form (Rei Kawakubo’s first store did not even have mirrors), clothes were given the potential to be something more. Taking inspiration not from the long history of western haute-couture but from a network of Japanese artists, architects and other innovators in their contemporary culture, their designs became imbued with a spirit that directly challenged and deconstructed fashion’s rules and touched on a more innate sense of identity. They took fashion into the abstract and the world has never looked back.
