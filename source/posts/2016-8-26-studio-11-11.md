Given Marijne and Annabels history with interior design and architecture it’s no surprise that they feel most comfortable when working with natural materials. It was this shared inspiration that led the two to start designing leather accessories out of their design studio, Studio 11:11 in Melbourne.

>Designing accessories is not all that different from designing a building in terms of the process - Marijne

Using processes and techniques used in architecture but less often seen in the world of fashion, the pair design durable and timelessly beautiful products.

*Through intentional detailing, considered design, and quality workmanship.*




Studio 11:11 aims to challenge the culture of mass-produced fast fashion. With an ethos that aims to reduce waste and ensure fair relationships with all suppliers, their products are both ethically sourced and sustainably crafted.

Newly released from the studio are the 11:11:02 fold bags. The pair took inspiration for the foldable structure of flat pack box, allowing them to create a bag that is unique in its minimalistic construction. Clever craftsmanship and leather manipulation let the material speak for itself, proving that design doesn’t have to be complicated to be sophisticated.
