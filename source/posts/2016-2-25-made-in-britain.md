In 2015, the Confederation of British Industry announced that the UK’s factory output had stagnated after 2 years of successive growth. In spite of such negative coverage, some British-manufactured labels saw less cause for concern.

Lea Mills - near Matlock in Derbyshire - has been the epicentre of British brand, John Smedley, for over 230 years now. The mill is built on a natural spring and continues to use the traditional double yarn technique - first seen in 1718 - whereby two strands are combined to create John Smedley’s unique and distinctive mottled garments.

The company remains a family enterprise and these values are intrinsically woven into the fabric of the business. In many cases the company continues to employ successive generations of workers; one employee has worked the same machine since 1979.

>The machines are largely idiosyncratic: The relationship between man and machine is woven into the very fabric of each garment.

John Smedley take what they know - the manipulation of wool - and continually apply this knowledge to new and emerging markets. The company’s recent foray into cycling wear - culminating in ‘The John Smedley for Man of Steel’ cycling jersey - is a textbook example of just this.

Conscious of the brand’s heritage, the design team at John Smedley constantly reference their classic styles (courtesy of an extensive on-site archive) whilst subtly incorporating new turns in both knitwear - design and production.

Despite on-going discussions about moving production overseas, the call is yet to be made. The choice to remain in the UK delights John Smedley’s distributors, who subsequently reap the financial rewards of the brand’s ‘Made in Britain’ label.

But it is not just heritage brands who can benefit from British manufacture.
Albam founders, Alastair Rae and James Shaw, based their company’s manufacturing in the Midlands, taking advantage of the wealth of factories left over from the heyday of Britain’s industrial era.

*The factory is now a sprawling space that has been added to over many years*

Although the pair lived and studied in the area, the choice was not for sentimental reasons. Driven exclusively by quality, they found that British was best. Having seen the business go from strength to strength over the past 10 years, Rae firmly believes that British factories are more efficient than ever in meeting and creating consumer demand.

However, unlike John Smedley, Albam actively shy away from asserting the ‘Made in Britain’ label as a brand value. Rae ultimately sees this label as a flippant marketing tool; one moment it may be fashionable to wear clothes made in the UK but the next it isn’t. The real advantages for Albam are that their clothes do not sit in shipping containers for months on end, ultimately allowing for a higher-quality product, seamless distribution and an easily-monitored supply chain.

With Albam’s clothing, a personal connection between wearer and producer exists specifically because of the nuances in UK manufacture. The labels use of batch production means alterations can occur during the manufacturing process. Subsequently each garment is subject to rigorous quality assurance and additional touches are made to perfect it.

It appears there is still everything to play for in the world of UK manufacture. These brands prove that the myth of Great British quality is more like a well-founded legend. Long may this legacy continue.
