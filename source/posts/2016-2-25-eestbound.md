If you love hip-hop or music in general, it is almost impossible to ignore the constant flow of sonic excellence emanating from Toronto, Canada.

The region has recently seen the likes of Majid Jordan, PARTYNEXTDOOR & Roy Wood$ trending on the airwaves, to name but a handful. Perhaps even more importantly, Toronto is playing host to a new breed of super-producers, blissfully augmenting the sound of popular culture behind soundproofed doors.

In an era where the mozart-like minds behind hit records are becoming as revered and celebrated as the recording artist themselves, you will inevitably find production duo, EESTBOUND & Wondagurl.

At only 19 years old, Wondagurl already has a series of production credits on major studio albums including; Jay-Z’s ‘Magna Carta Holy Grail’ and Drake’s ‘If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late’. To some extent she could be considered a veteran of the industry already.

Her new partner in crime, Dutch-born multi-instrumentalist Bryan Van Mierlo (AKA EESTBOUND)  - also only 19 himself - plays the guitar, piano, bass, and drums to a level of maturity far beyond his age. Since their partnership began in 2014, the talented pair went on to produce some of 2015’s most exciting releases from artists such as Travi$ Scott and Young Thug.

One chilly winter’s evening, in a dimly lit Toronto recording studio known as Studio 64, hevnly found EESTBOUND refusing to use a guitar synth, craving the authenticity of 'the real thing'. He nostalgically recounts how the absence of a real guitar during his childhood inspired lego-constructed alternatives or the repurposing of a violin - his brother often chastised him for holding it 'the wrong way'.

An innate need to express himself saw him enter a musical talent competition, where he was warned that only those who read sheet music could win. Against all the odds, he won the competition by performing an original composition. On moving to Toronto, he got an iPhone and, using an iTunes gift card, bought Apple’s music-making software - Garageband. At that moment EESTBOUND was born.

'I like to create beats that are unpredictable,' he remarks. '...if I'm gonna give you what you expect, I'm going to make sure that it's exactly what you want … and more'. Wondagurl is entirely supportive as both nod their heads in tandem. 'I'm his biggest fan … when it comes to beats,' she beams proudly.

It’s refreshing to see she hasn't become disillusioned with all the new found fame and industry respect she now commands. Both charming and assertive at the same time, her reserved nature, softly-spoken voice and well-mannered demeanour only serve to make her more attractive and personable.

Their music is characteristically dark and full-bodied, yet each artists’ idiosyncrasies also find a place. EESTBOUND’s beats are unmistakeable, deep gravelly baselines make your insides wobble, snares snap wirth neck-break ferocity, and eclectic synth-pads allow the tracks plenty of space to breathe.

Watching artists at work is always a privilege. That privilege is even greater knowing this music could one day be bumping out of sound systems across the globe, whipping people up into a frenzy and unlocking that emotional DNA that only a gifted few artists have the keys to.
