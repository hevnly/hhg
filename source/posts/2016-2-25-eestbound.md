It is almost impossible to ignore the torrent of emerging artists overflowing from Canada and Toronto in particular - with the likes of Majid Jordan, PARTYNEXTDOOR & Roy Wood$ currently trending on the airwaves. Toronto isn’t shy on its productive talent pool either; a quick google search will reveal names such as T-Minus, 40 and Wondagurl. These stage names are in fact the aliases of a new breed of super-producers behind a noteworthy number of hit records that have augmented the sound of popular culture. In a musical era, where the mozart-like minds behind hit  songs are becoming as relevant as the recording artist themselves, Bryan Van Mierlo AKA EESTBOUND together with Canada’s own Wondagurl, are creative masterminds responsible for some of the most relevant hip-hop releases of 2015. Yet another Toronto export whose studio antics have been forcing fingers to frantically twist volume control dials, thumbs to attack ‘volume-up’ buttons and people to physically, emotionally and literally, as the vernacular goes, “turn-up” in nightclubs and concerts the world over.

Mainstream recognition is always relevant, but acknowledgement holds more weight when it comes from respected voices from within an industry. An entire show on the Apple-owned Beats 1 radio station, Soulection, inspired by and dedicated to their beat-making antics only serves to amplify the waves they’re making. One chilly December evening in a dimly lit Toronto recording studio known as Studio 64, the twosome discuss their aspirations to get more into photography. It seems that melodic sustenance alone is not enough to satisfy their hunger and innate need to create. Super producer Wondagurl (real name Ebony Oshunrinde) marvels at some artwork she’s discovered on her phone - "That artwork is so beautiful”. "I agree" concurs Bryan, "I need that artwork in my life”. Both seem at ease and effortlessly in tune with one another, even when they’re not working. Most marriages would do well to learn a lesson from this match; communication is effortless, humour shared, respect mutual.

Multi talented Bryan plays the guitar, piano, bass and drums and such a high level of maturity at such a 19 years old, it is obvious he will leave a positively indelible mark on music. During this particular session, he refuses to use a guitar synth because he craves the authenticity of the real thing. He is clearly a perfectionist, with a natural yearn to be the best - so it was only fitting that he worked with one of the best. Wondagurl and EESTBOUND began collaborating in 2014 after connecting online. At just 17, with a series of productions that found their way onto major studio albums, Wondagurl was already arguably an industry veteran. Apparently never afraid to ask questions, EESTBOUND reached out to Wondagurl and naturally, they hit it off...Watching the synergy between them is akin to watching a married couple; Whilst in the unfamiliar studio he, itching to get creating, is persistent with his questions. Like the stereotypical male in a typical marriage, always asking the wife questions; Where does this plug in? What should I turn on first?. And patiently (like the stereotypical more patient female) Wondagurl points him in the right direction….trying (and failing) to suppress a smile tugged by Bryan's childish sexual innuendo about "plugging something in" and "turning it on".

The music itself is characteristically dark and full bodied, complemented by each artist’s signature idiosyncrasies, creating something special and mood altering every single time. Eastbound beats are unmistakeable - with their deep gravelly baselines that make one's insides wobble, cracking snares that snap with enough ferocity to leave you in a neck-brace, eclectic synths and sound effects that are perfectly timed and creatively spaced. Wondagurl is supportive at all times as both of them bop their heads in tandem. Those nods quickly turn to shakes when the subject of New York is brought up. “…its too busy and fast moving for me...I like to chill" - a surprising retort for someone so young and so well regarded within the hip-hop scene.

>I just wanted to do my own thing

With her work featured on Jay-Z’s Magna Carta Holy Grail and Drake’s If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, She too shows a great degree of maturity and realism. It’s refreshing to know that she hasn't become disillusioned with the new found fame and industry respect she now commands. Her shyness is humbling. She's charming and commanding at the same time. Her reserved nature, softly-spoken voice and well mannered demeanour only serve to make her more attractive and personable. Both Van-Mierlo and Oshunrinde are prime examples of the effortless multiculturalism that defines Toronto. With EESTBOUND born and raised in Holland and Wondagurl raised in a predominantly Nigerian family, the duo seem to have brought the best elements of their backgrounds with them into the studio - perhaps an advantage they have over their competition. Presumably both family oriented people, it’s clear why collaborating and respect are at the core of their values. "I'm his biggest fan...when it comes to beats” she beams proudly as the session comes to an end.

Listening to a work in progress is an interesting experience. Knowing that you're in the proverbial kitchen of a prolific chef and you know what's currently in the frying pan is going to be a hell of a meal when it's finished - like all greats in any field, the one thing they all have in common is  the gift of foresight. EESTBOUND is no different, he says he likes to create beats that are unpredictable. It seems that he’s already looking (and listening) ahead from the listener's point of view and trying to feel out what they'd expect. "If I'm gonna give you what you expect, I'm going to make sure that it's exactly what you want...and more". It's a privilege listening to music in the process of being made that might one day in the near future be a hit - bumping out of sound systems across the globe - whipping people up into a frenzy and unlocking that emotional DNA that only a gifted few artists have the keys to. If 2015 was the poison, 2016 will be the antidote.
