The Cocteau Twins, one group that perfectly captures both beauty and experimentation through an unorthodox approach to rock music, which has been said to spawn a whole genre, shoegaze. Built around shimmering guitar, atmospheric production and truly incomparable vocals their sound becomes impressionistic – almost outside of time.

>1979 Grangemouth spawned the seminal band the Cocteau Twins

The group formed in 1979 in the small town of Grangemouth when childhood friends Robin Guthrie and William Heggie met Elizabeth Fraser on the dance floor of the local disco, “Nash”. After working on their first songs, the group found themselves on a night bus to London to see The Birthday Party. They brought with them only two cassettes, cassettes which would later become their first studio album, 1982’s Garlands. Dropping one at John Peel’s office at the BBC and pressing the other directly into the hands of Ivo Watts-Russell of record label 4AD; they returned to Scotland and waited for a response – a response they knew would come. Watts-Russell immediately invited them down to play and after first hearing the band with Fraser’s voice (that was inaudible on the tape) they were signed. Call it youthful naivete or justified self-belief, the music clearly spoke for itself.

So what is this sound that still remains so distinguished? It has often been described as ethereal, otherworldly, and even as “the voice of god”. These airy descriptions reflect the importance of ambiguity and atmosphere over clarity and choruses.

Robin Guthrie’s guitar uses distortion and delay with simplicity to create a sense of space. Less traditional musicianship, prevalent in so many bands, is met with a similar approach to production through Guthrie and Simon Raymonde (who replaced Heggerty after Garlands). This roughness and layering of sound is at home in an era where anybody can pirate their own software and experiment with production free from preconceptions.

>When they first emerged in the early 80s, The Cocteau Twins were compared most often to Siouxsie & The Banshees, but in truth they never sounded like anyone – or anything – else.

And then there are Liz Fraser’s soprano vocals so immediately and powerfully recognizable. After the lyrically discernible first album, Fraser’s later and most iconic work with the Cocteau twins rejected fully intelligible lyrics. In being bound simply by mere impressions of words her voice becomes more sensuous and subjective, almost operatic. Definitive meaning is repressed in the abstract lyrics. Although, album titles such as Garlands, Victorialand, Heaven or Las Vegas and even Four-Calender Café open up ideas of ambiguous places. like much with the band, the lyrical distance invites interpretation whilst always guarding against it.

The appearance and style of the group, made up of unmistakable wild frizzy haircuts met with short sides and timeless, clean-cut, black and white 50’s shirts, imply an aesthetic of instantly attractive simplicity overlying something more intangible. The album covers too, with treasure’s dark whirling lines over the antique floral white dress, and the almost burning neon swirls over deep blue and red of heaven or las vegas, create a sense of simultaneous stasis and movement – something immediately present that is equally impossible to pin down.

Textured and immersive but always with the impression of effortlessness; their releases, culminating with what many see as the 1990 masterpiece, ‘Heaven or Las Vegas’, are still being reissued today.

>We like it better than all our last records... we can't do any better than that.'We think all our other ones are fucking crap. I'm slightly proud of a couple of tracks on a couple of them, but essentially I'm really embarrassed about what we've done in the past… - Robin Guthrie on Heaven or Las vegas

by 1997 the relationship between Guthrie and Fraser, strained by Guthrie’s problems with addiction, was damaged beyond repair and the group split. With the resurgence of shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive and Ride in recent years, many have been hoping for a similar return from the band that helped start it all. This seems unlikely but there is solace in the music; for whilst many innovators eventually become dated, in a sound so expansive, every single listen can offer something new.
