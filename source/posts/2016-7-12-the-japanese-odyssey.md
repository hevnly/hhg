The ‘land of the rising sun’ synonymously known to many simply as ‘Japan’, possesses colossal landscapes and is highly regarded as a cyclist’s paradise, especially for veterans of the sport. Understood for its nuanced, and complex culture, Japan offers many more distinctive wonders. Even with this guarantee of everlasting ignorance, the cycling tradition acts as a powerful tool to bridge that cultural gap and create bonds with like-minded people around the world. In recent years, the local fixation with bicycles has become ever more prominent especially with image-conscious Japanese adolescents, notably fixed-wheel bicycles. Designed for track racing but transforming a regular bike into a “fixie” - or “piste bike,” as they are known in Japan - is a straightforward operation and allows the rider to stop by resisting the rotation of the pedals. 

Japan stereotypically renowned for its densely populated cities and congested roads, also offers plenty of alternative circuits, transporting cyclists through some of the most breathtaking scenery east Asia has to offer. While some of the most enthusiastic cyclists will travel far distances of the country, a new type of tour offers enthusiasts an unparalleled course to explore new regions.               

Now into its second edition, ‘the Japanese Odyssey’ sends riders from Tokyo to Osaka. While the two major cities are a few hundred kilometers apart, the idea involves each participant covering the entire distance in their own time but must complete the outing within fourteen days. Most modern day travelers take the two-and-a-half hour Shinkansen bullet train between the two cities, turning the beautiful scenery outside into one long, fuzzy blur. The meandering bicycle route offers a much more picturesque and intimate view of the countryside. Riders have the choice of whichever route they wish to journey, although they must pass designated checkpoints which encourages a voyage through areas of cultural significance as well as remote and mountainous regions. While some may opt to take a more direct route, others may favour to drift and explore the captivating Japanese landscapes.

Established by bicycle enthusiasts, the endurance event commits to offering participants an enthralling glimpse into the unique bike culture and beautiful vistas of Japan.
