‘the white man might have invented these clothes, but we have turned it into an art,’ remarks brazzaville musician king kester emeneya, a bold statement that succinctly captures the revolutionary spirit of ‘le sape’, the socio-moralistic fashion and lifestyle movement based either side of the congo river in the cities of brazzaville and kinshasa.

etymological theories of the word ‘sape’ are numerous; some think it alludes to the french slang word ‘sape' meaning ‘attire’, others feel it derives from the more formal ‘se saper’ meaning ‘to dress elegantly’. however, in its modern incarnation it is widely understood to be an abbreviation, coined by congolese youth living in paris, for ‘société des ambianceurs et des personnes élégantes’ - the society of ambiance-makers and elegant people. les sapeurs (as they are collectively known) have been attracting swathes of publicity in recent years with their colourful elevation of aesthetic presentation and performance to political and quasi-religious status. having been a source of academic interest over the past few decades, the congolese ‘dandies’ have more recently appeared in a music video for solange knowles’ ‘losing you’ in 2012 and last year were the centrepiece in one of the iconic guinness advertisements. indeed, it has been a long journey for le sape.

the group is thought to have taken its recognisable shape during the 60’s in the bacongo neighbourhood of brazzaville just before the republic of congo gained independence from french colonial powers. however, traditions of dandyism in the congo can be traced as far back as the 1920’s when colonial ‘masters’ would give clothes to their servants so that they would ‘fit in’.

>it’s about a lot of things, about beating the west at its own game, which is fashion: you colonized us but we dress better than you.

although the rise of le sape has it’s roots in counter-colonial discourse, by the late 60’s their philosophy had crossed the congo river and immediately began playing a central, antagonistic role challenging mobutu sese seko’s regime in kinshasa. mobutu’s policy of ‘authenticité’ was a direct response to the colonial domination just-passed and, amongst other changes in state and private conduct, forbade congolese peoples from wearing western-style clothing and instead forced them to wear the ‘abacost’ - a mao-style traditional tunic. on a nationwide scale, with globalisation and world progress in a state of hyper-flux, this traditionalist policy felt counter-intuitive to many congolese. the importance of le sape at this time really needs no further explanation. after the 90’s the shackles of authenticité had been shaken off and the le sape returned again to the heart of its initial conflict, but this time on the newly globalised ideological battlefield.

>the sapeur is also about masculinity, politics, [and] changing the stereotypes about how people view africa.

to modern sapeurs, the ultimate message behind ‘sapologie’ is to inspire gentlemanliness, non-violence and identity empowerment. an individual is the master of their own identity and regardless of their situation can choose to be respectful of others, well-mannered and, of course, well-dressed. in many respects the correlation suggested earlier between le sape and religious movements is uncanny; it has a cosmological founding figure - the congolese revolutionary andré matsoua, the first grand sapeur of the congo - and a pope-like figure by the name of papa griffe, who currently acts as living representative of the movement. a trip to paris, known by sapeurs as ‘l’aventure’, serves as a sartorial pilgrimage for the group, and furthermore, les sapeurs dedicate an exorbitant amount of their income to their faith. even with a quantity of their attire being shoplifted by congolese gangs operating in the capital cities of europe and sold to les sapeurs at a fraction of the commercial price tag, some sapeurs have been known to spend up to £700 on a single item. no small feat considering that the monthly wage is anywhere between £40 and £100, usually lower in kinshasa than brazzaville.

the often vibrant choice of clothes is not what one might expect from a revolutionary’s wardrobe but at this point it is important to stress the stylistic distinction between les sapeurs of brazzaville and kinshasa. the brazzaville style is the eccentric and colourful commercial ‘face’ of the movement. it is generally considered bad form to dress in more than three colours and important that eccentricity, for all it’s worth, does not overshadow elegance. other stylistic idiosyncrasies include leaving the bottom cuff button of a suit jacket undone and jacket vents being no more than 32 centimetres in height. it is considered ‘tacky’ to champion brands but amongst the most popular include; versace, cavalli, french shoemaker j.m.weston and favourbrook of jermyn street. within the brazzaville style there are sub-groups, most notably the piccadilly group whose hallmark is the scottish kilt. for brazzaville sapes it is their pastiche of classical western style, blending tongue-in-cheek colonial attire and their own flamboyant individualism, that defines them.

on the other hand, the kinshasan arm exhibits the movement’s darker, urbanised undertones sporting a mostly-black and punk-inspired style that wouldn’t look out of place on the streets of berlin. for this pallet, designers such as; yohji yamamoto, g-star, dior and kenzo come to the fore. the ‘kin’ sape does not adorn its style with strict dress rules as it is felt that their violent and brutal approach to style more appropriately reflects the kinshasa spirit.

le sape’s adventure into the global village has attracted furious debate, but the issue remains far from black and white. some believe their being-headhunted by the juggernaut of western commerce is nothing short of neo-colonial exploitation and cultural appropriation at its finest, others believe the whole movement may be soiled by a similar cloth. in general the exhibition of moral imperatives for profit like some sort of social pornography sits uneasy with most. however, in this case such arguments ultimately deny the agency of les sapeurs to choose their own style. ignoring what le sape means to sapeurs themselves could be seen to uphold the very power dynamics that are trying to be addressed by the movement.

it is a question that has no clear answer, relying on many abstract processes to contextualise a response. in either case, at least one thing is true - never has such a grey area been so very colourful.
