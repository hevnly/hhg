From the rough and ready insight into city life of the early 90’s MC’s to the total decadence of the later decade, the influence of the hip-hop music video is still being felt in many facets of our contemporary culture. Hip-hop artists’ engagement with this open visual form has led to some of the most visceral music videos to date and pushed forward the potential of hip-hop as an art form but also as a vehicle for social change.

*Nothin' But a G Thang*

In a time before the internet and social media allowed us to follow our favourite artists’ every waking breath, the music video was an art form that truly brought Hip-Hop, and its creators, to life - via our living rooms. Early videos of the period illustrated the harsh realities experienced by the artists. Recurring dilapidated urban settings create the atmosphere. Derelict buildings and deserted subways showcase an art form still at odds with six-figure record deals. New York claustrophobic streets litter the videos of the East Coast’s finest, such as in Big L’s ‘Put It On’ or Mobb Deep’s ‘Shook Ones’. Likewise the distinctive Compton boulevards of the West Coast in videos such as Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre’s ‘Nuthin' But A G Thang’ give a grounded aesthetic that mirrors the uncensored portrayals of violence, crime and marginalisation present in the lyrics. Dr. Dre was the director of his own video in ‘Nuthin but a G Thang’ that introduces us to Snoop Dogs family in the first scene. Amateur acting, a cookout with a gun-strapping chef, lowriders and volleyball, this was a homage to their experience, not cliche. Groups of artists and associates come together for the videos that is at once a case of safety in numbers and an illustration of the unifying potential of Hip-Hop.These artists didn’t have stylists or models or actors; it was their immediate circle, their talent and their personal environment on show, but the influence of their style perhaps resonates most vividly with the youth today. Carhart, Tommy Hilfiger, Timbalands and Clarkes Wallabes, just to name a few, are all still street-style staples.

*Mobb Deep - Shook Ones*

What always shines through so powerfully in this type of video is a sense of authenticity, a priority that has since returned in the Drill scene that revealed to the world the dangers that still plague areas of Chicago. These videos provided a true snapshot into the lives of incredibly talented musicians, often surrounded by deprived and violent circumstances. Addressing these elements of society, and challenging them through a gritty and understated aesthetic renders these  videos still arresting and important.

It could be said the development of Hip-Hop rejected authenticity for an antithetical extravagance. The later Jiggy era of the mid to late 90’s would define hip-hop well into the 2000’s and showcased the aesthetic of wealth that Hip-Hop could create from breaking the mainstream market. This is manifest nowhere more vividly than in the videos of those such as Hype Williams. Exaggeration, energy, and sheer extremity are all words that encompass the carefree celebration of success and wealth. In his video for Busta Rhymes’ ‘Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See’, a take on Eddie Murphy’s ‘Coming to America’ is met with a psychedelic twist. Exquisite costumes and a supporting cast that includes an elephant shows how far the potential of the form had grown. Missy Elliot’s  ‘The Rain [Supa Dupa Fly]’ sees the Hip-Hop legend don the, now infamous, bin-bag suit, ride around in a Hummer seen through the classic fisheye lens. Artistic expression could become less serious, more exaggerated and carefree, reflected in the shifting vibrantly coloured outfit changes and disjointed dancing. While not as immediately socially-conscious, they expressed an artistic confidence and attitude that is unmistakably a continuation from the earliest ethos. This shift was a measure of how things had changed with African-American culture having cemented its position at the centre of the mainstream.

Alongside these styles are more narrative and immediately creative works. The Pharcyde’s video for ‘The Drop’, directed by Spike Jonze, needed a voice coach to be hired so that the MC’s could learn to say their lyrics backwards allowing a reality bending video filmed in reverse with the lyrics still clearly portrayed by the MC’s actually saying them backwards. In 1996, The Roots took the music video meta, criticising the extravagance and avarice of hip-hop culture and its fakers in the video for ‘What They Do’. This took stereotypical elements of the videos and brought them down to size with perfectly dated typed comments and a deadpan delivery. Estates on show are ‘(rented for the day)’, the champagne is ‘(really ginger ale)’ and other tropes are comically called ‘Big Willie-isms’ in a video that holds back no punches.

This tension between differing ideals of hip-hop was manifest in the huge variety of talent being showcased in the medium but also reflects how the rise of the music video could bring these tensions to a wider audience. Whether the video was a visual stimulant complementing the harsh reality in the lyrics, or a raucously free and celebratory visual feast, it is clear the hip hop video was an art form constantly pushing at the boundaries of music, style and society.
