Magnus Reid takes his responsibilities seriously. ‘For me, buying local is as, if not more important than buying a certified organic product’, he says. ‘People often overlook emissions, and transit spraying, fishing quotas and all that kind of thing.’ We’re sitting in c.r.e.a.m. cafe, a daytime canteen located in new inn yard, Shoreditch, where Magnus — blond, nearly six foot, and covered in tattoos — is head chef.

c.r.e.a.m. is clean, comfortable, inviting. The style might just about be called elegant, but there’s enough of interest to avoid a deadening minimalism. Framed photographs hang from white brick and plaster walls, potted herbs, ferns and cacti litter the room, and all is lit from above by drooping spot - and pendant lights that glow warm yellow beneath an exposed ceiling. Wooden tables and countertops complete the look.

*some of the finer details found in the cafe*

Around the corner from c.r.e.a.m. is the site of what was once “the Theatre”, built in 1576 but long since vanished, where several of Shakespeare's early plays were performed. While the cafe hasn’t been around that long, c.r.e.a.m. has brought something special to Shoreditch life since its founding in January 2015. Not content with the challenge of a menu that changes every week, the menu at c.r.e.a.m. changes every day. ‘A lot of our menu is thought out at least a day or two before,’ Magnus says. ‘Because we’re a café we have the opportunity to change our offering.’

This ever-changing menu means that dishes are based on what’s fresh at the market; meals follow ingredients, not the other way round. ‘I’ve worked with most of my suppliers for a long time,’ Magnus says. ‘I trust them, which is important. If my veg guy (Dennis at bill Bean) sends me french strawberries over British during the season, he normally has a pretty good reason.’ But you have to be quick. ‘They often email out a list of what they have, so it’s first come first serve.’ How much work goes into this? ‘Not much. We maintain a super simple menu. We have some staple dishes we go back to when it’s been a busy week and we are too brain dead to think.’

To Magnus the use of seasonal ingredients and local suppliers is just part of being responsible. ‘It’s better to buy a small producer that’s close by over a big organic company,’ he says. ‘we try to work with a couple of smaller people.’ Does that mean he avoids larger companies entirely? ‘Both have their benefits. Usually, the organic companies try to lower emissions too.’ This idea of responsibility extends to people too. There is a “no laptops on the weekend” policy at c.r.e.a.m. in a time when work-life balance is hard to find, Magnus does his part to foster a sense of play.

It’s not all play, of course. During the week c.r.e.a.m. fizzes with the entrepreneurial energy of east London, and people can be seen meeting, greeting, and eating the rich variety of foods on offer. Protein magazine is around the corner, and together with c.r.e.a.m. they host regular events at the cafe. These events, known as “insights”, range from talks about the future of feminism to film screenings and exhibitions. At these events, drinks are served, and the sliding glass doors that serve as the entrance to c.r.e.a.m. are fanned out, opening the café to the cool of the night.

One of the striking things about c.r.e.a.m. is that Magnus himself roams the cafe floor, serving food and coffee alongside his staff. This seems to be the ethos at c.r.e.a.m., where there is a “no bullshit” approach that serves as an antidote to the pretentiousness which marks the contemporary cafe scene. It comes as no surprise, then, to learn that Magnus started out on the cafe scene in Perth, Australia. but cooking was always a weekend job; his real desire was to become a tattoo artist. Fortunately for us, food took over. After arriving in London in his late teens—‘perth wasn’t that fun’—magnus “staged” in kitchens like St John before moving on to the hackney pearl. Soon, though, Magnus decided to try his hand at running a cafe. Along with several pop-up food events, Magnus was jointly responsible for the rooftop cafe in London bridge and Tuckshop in Shoreditch, before moving on to c.r.e.a.m.

It’s a good thing too that Magnus gave up his dreams of the tattoo industry; there is real artistry at work in his kitchen. Travelling to c.r.e.a.m. at the death of summer, Magnus prepared three dishes: A tangy beetroot and green bean salad, hot chorizo and warm cannellini beans speckled with chopped basil, and thinly sliced yellow courgette served with chickpeas, cream, and a mint garnish. Although each dish was relatively simple, and presented without pretension, the delight was in their interaction. Each was elegant in its own right, but each found its complement in the others, creating a perfect ensemble. The fresh coldness of the beetroot salad was balanced by the hearty warmth of the chorizo and cannellini beans, which in turn was matched with the thick herby cream and delicately seasoned courgette, the last of the summer harvest. Magnus had produced the perfect accompaniment to the half-time of seasons’ change.

Most of these ingredients, as mentioned, came from small, independent farms. In fact, one of c.r.e.a.m.’s suppliers, topfield farm, is so little that they only supply to Magnus. ‘jono is a mate and lets us get into the goods,’ Magnus says. ‘Amazing apples and plums as of late.’ Coffee comes from Campbell and Syme—‘these boys are roasting some really interesting coffee’ — and bread is supplied by alarm at seven seeded artisan bakery. ‘I love these guys because they don’t do gluten free bread’, Magnus says. ‘I have nothing against coeliacs, but I admire how seven seeded stick with what they do best and only do that.’

Magnus and c.r.e.a.m. show that sustainability and responsibility don’t have to come at the cost of taste, appearance, or accomplishment. But what’s next for Magnus? ‘who knows? [Magnus’s business partner] Andy and I have been throwing around ideas. Probably moving back into restaurants and wine.’ No plans for c.r.e.a.m. then? ‘c.r.e.a.m. is a model that could expand. But I think at the moment we enjoy it being its small self.’
