To some she is an influencer, to others a director or stylist. Either way, all India’s projects are united by her minimalist individual aesthetic - as she emphatically states:  'Regardless of the brand - that’s my priority.'

*Anonymity, adjective "anonymous", is derived from the Greek word, anonymia, meaning "without a name" or "namelessness"*

Growing up in both London and Chester, creativity was encouraged early-on by her mother and step-father: 'Our dining table was always covered with drawings and paint and we made our own Jackson Pollock paintings with drumsticks and spoons'. The defining moment came when the family bought their first SLR camera: 'I loved taking pictures from that moment.'

Subsequently she went on to study photography at college, followed by Fashion Communication and Promotion at university. It was during this period that India recognized her natural eye for composition: ‘Technically I wasn’t ever very good - I never could get my head around the dark room and studio lighting - but composition was second nature. And I loved it.'

>As contradictory as it may seem, self-promotion has now taken on a whole new meaning in the digital world.

This intuitive eye found its outlet through her fashion blog: 'Within a year brands were contacting me, Instagram became a thing, and it just snowballed.' But while it may have led to full time employment as a Social Media Manager, the lack of creative control was suffocating.

'By then, brands were flying me across the world to cover Fashion Week and store openings,’ she explains, 'so I quit my job, moved to London, and sofa surfed my way into the world of freelance.'

*Averted faces, spectral cars from an American past, a unique eye for fashion and elegant composition: this is the work of India Rose.*

Now India has moved back behind the camera and into the role of Creative Director, producing what she describes as 'quality imagery' revolving around an aesthetic of anonymity. This is, in part, a reaction to the blogging area of the fashion industry India knows so well.

'As contradictory as it may seem, self-promotion has now taken on a whole new meaning in the digital world. It’s dishonest, superficial and doesn’t do anything for your self-esteem.'
But as India explains, these are symptoms of wider issues in the industry: 'Creatives need to be paid fairly, and on time, for their work. There is only so much “good exposure” a creative can take before they need to pay the bills.' There is an increasingly fine line to tread between control of your work and the need to “monetise”; a desire to be socially conscious and promote brands you love.

With the majority of paid work resting in the hands of what India describes as 'corporate brands with a lot of capital,’ she laments on how physical appearance is still what people respond to most.

Despite its negatives, the internet’s versatility remains a huge part of India’s inspiration and work: 'It’s all about your environment,’ she explains. If you’re in a pattern cutting studio and constantly surrounded by fabric, you’re going to think about clothing. But the Internet is not like a pattern cutting studio; it’s also a painters studio, a photographer’s gallery, a magazine and a TV channel.'

Undoubtedly this multi-media platform offers a deserving space for such a creative mind. As India reassuringly asserts: there will be much more to come.
