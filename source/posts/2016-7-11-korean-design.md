An artisan by definition is a worker in a skilled trade, especially one that involves making things by hand. When investigating the design industry, there are a handful of exemplary cases hailing from  south Korea. Over a decade of work to develop a thriving manufacturing network, they’ve also been successful at defining design capabilities and nurturing strong brands. While its neighbouring countries in southeast Asia often take centre stage for cultural and political influence, these select makers are just as deserving.

The product of a worldly influences and classical art forms, in 1988 under the label “solid homme” Woo Young Mi became the first female designer of a ready-to-wear menswear brand in Korea. Born in Seoul and having studied fashion at the university, her now eponymous label “wooyoungmi” is recognized for its clean and delicate perspective and skilled tailoring. Having grown up in a post-war nation still rife with political unrest, while not directly, Woo Young Mi may very well have been forged by those fires. From Kim Whan-Ki and Lee Jung Seob’s re-interpretations of western art to traditional hanok houses and royal palaces, since world war ii, Korean art has shown remarkable originality and innovation.

With futuristic structures on often awe-inspiring scale married with calm and serene topology, the “modern Korean” architecture has electrified international conversation on design. Grand public spaces designed with a holistic and human-centric approach are leaving outstanding impressions from Korean designers. Founded in his hometown of Seoul in 2003, mass studies is the brainchild of award-winning architect Minsuk Cho. Similarly but perhaps even more set in a time far from now, JOHO architecture’s striking buildings simultaneously blend into its surroundings harmoniously while making itself the focus. Under its logo, umzikim reads “work and life”, simple words which convey so much but at once, succinctly what the industrial brand represents. Founded in 2001 based in both Seoul and manila, their catalogue of desks, bookshelves, and stands is straightforwardly about function. But looking at the smartly engineered and playful products, form and character is not lost. From the slant of the “velero” or “bookslide” set, there is a lighthearted movement built into its dna.

Looking at design in its most prolific iterations—fashion, architectural, and industrial—south Korea continues to move forward with an approach that is both inspired and enterprising while remaining respectful to its cultural heritage and core design traditions. Open to agile changes and untested waters, they’re still distinguishing what makes korean design so unique. And with the help of these visionaries to establish an idiosyncratic design identity, Korea is quickly stepping out into its own spotlight.
