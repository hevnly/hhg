basquiat’s story has been told in countless ways from countless perspectives. that of poet to junkie, of bohemian run-away to millionaire art-idol and of a black artist struggling to find purchase in a largely white industry. unsurprisingly his work grapples with a multitude of dualisms inherent to our existence, expressing tensions he felt increasingly at the epicentre of throughout his life. however, as basquiat mentioned himself on numerous occasions, the public eye and word focused acutely on his personal particulars often as a distraction from anything of real interest; his work and process.

quite literally emerging from the streets of manhattan, he was first noticed through a collaborative graffiti-poetry project with ‘al diaz' under the pseudonym, ‘samo’ - a loose acronym for “same old shit”. under cover of night the pair would anonymously scrawl short and cryptic text throughout manhattan and sign it off with a copyright logo. the urban spectres quickly began to arrest attention with their poignant observations.

from a young age it was clear that basquiat had a gifted mind. by the age of eight he could read and write in english, french and spanish. it seems like poetic justice that a being with such zest for communication should possess such artistic talent.

he seamlessly inhabited the dionysian type-cast shared by many heroes of popular culture, even his tragic death at 27 reeked of cult idolatry. basquiat was particularly inspired by the beat movement - most prominently william burroughs - whose own process of collaging different pages of prose to form abstract sentences, basquiat would come to assimilate in his work.

basquiat had a passion for music and it also became central to his process. deeply embedded in his work one can see stylistic influence and even portraits of icons from funk, bebop and hip-hop through to punk rock, deep jazz and classical music - indeed those close to him remember ravel’s ‘boléro’ being a favourite in his studio. wherever basquiat was working a myriad of noise would surely follow. usually he would have music playing, the television on, the radio on as well as books and newspapers strewn across the desks and floors. he liked to create a hive of stimuli around him from which he would constantly borrow words or images for his work.

in 1979 basquiat formed noise-rock band, ‘gray’ - named after the medical textbook ‘gray’s anatomy’, a text that also influenced the quasi-anatomical figures in basquiat’s artworks. the band’s sound, like basquiat’s painting style, was largely anti-technical yet bursting with energy. the members would use their instruments much like one would intuitively decipher the operation of a household appliance or computer programme. an approach that bred a wholly original sound and an unorthodox live show. at gigs basquiat wildly played the clarinet or the guitar using a steel file and often he would exhibit some of his pieces as well.

basquiat described his process as that of “constant editing”. in furious moments he would scribble his racing thoughts down on canvas (or door, or plank of wood, or napkin) and then edit-out or paint over sections when another wave of inspiration crashed against him.

>some commentators have humorously likened his method to sigmund freud’s famous ‘talking cure’.

this process became a trademark of basquiat’s work. for example, ever-the-master of putting himself in the right place at the right time - basquiat boldly interrupted andy warhol having lunch one afternoon and asked warhol if he might buy a postcard of his work - which, much to basquiat’s surprise, he did. the pair formed an extremely close friendship thereafter, culminating in a collaboration where they also used basquiat’s editing process. warhol would usually start the compositions and then basquiat, often to warhol’s annoyance, would edit and so-on. today their work is highly revered, but at the time their collaboration received much criticism and led to a fracture in the their relationship, a period crowned with paranoia and self-doubt. however - as testament to their friendship, if indeed we could call it a testament - it was not until andy’s death in february 1987 that jean-michel’s heroin use really began to get the better of him.

like his work, basquiat’s life was colourful and visceral with a hand-to-mouth simplicity that is often recognised as essential to the bohemian archetype. much of his work was a happy mistake, a reward for his unwavering confidence in whatever came from his brush. indeed the artist’s life and his work are beyond interchangeable - they are one. basquiat’s tragic demise is a reminder to us all that self-doubt is the end, not just of the creative process, but the process of being itself. a reminder that belief in oneself is not just preferable but fundamental.
