lingerie and family are rarely words that appear together. but for naomi de haan, founder of edge o’ beyond, family is at the heart of her designs. the name itself is taken from de haan's childhood home; each of the lingerie collections is named after a member of her family. the lyvie – a lingerie set in which bold silk lines cut through fine lace – attempts to capture the essence of her mother: delicate and beautiful, yet strong.

this melding of seemingly disparate concepts runs through the very core of edge o’ beyond. uniquely for a lingerie brand, it offers the possibility to attach gold dipped jewellery directly onto the pieces themselves. the hardware on the lingerie is 24 carat gold plated, and shaped in little circles (the ‘o’ in edge o’ beyond) to allow golden chains to be added and removed with ease. many would not automatically blend jewellery and lingerie: the former is a very public statement of style, and the latter is the most intimate form of dress. for de haan, however, this fusion combined her two great passions, and so felt entirely natural.

de haan’s route into the world of design itself was unconventional. she studied french and economics at university and it was her year abroad in paris that inspired her interest in luxury wear. de haan tells hevnly that she fell in love with parisian style. the city’s architecture and the creative people she met there reignited her interest in photography and sketching. despite moving back to london to complete her degree, she continues to take inspiration from the country and sources the core material for her product – exquisite leavers lace – from france.

unlike many of the larger lingerie brands, at edge o’ beyond the design process is intensely personal. throughout the year, de haan will sketch out ideas for new pieces as they come to her. when the time comes to begin a new season, she pulls out all her sketches and inspiration boards, and selects fabrics and colours based on what she would like to wear. the result is the beautifully whimsical offerings, a genuine effect of passion and care. the lingerie is made entirely within the united kingdom, and with only three product developers working with the label, the whole operation is intensely intimate.

yet edge o’ beyond’s ambitions extend outside of the local. the brand has already captured the imagination of the american market and is looking forward to expanding its global following. naomi de naan is excited about retaining the core concept of combining jewellery and lingerie while simultaneously experimenting with new shapes and materials. when asked what people can look forward to over the next few years, de haan tells hevnly that she is experimenting with incorporating leather into her designs, and hopes for an inaugural london boutique. this ambitious, sensitive designer and her burgeoning label look set to shake the world of luxury lingerie.
