Revolutionaries too often become icons of personality at the expense of their achievements and even their values. But for Rei Kawakubo, the notoriously reclusive designer and founder of Comme des Garçons, it is her creations that always take priority. From her very first show to her current collections, Kawakubo has irreversibly changed the face of fashion and retail whether you realise it or not. 

Born in Japan in 1946, Kawakubo never went to fashion school but instead studied fine art and literature. This lack of formal training meant that Kawakubo is a figure who has never been constrained by tradition or the attitudes of others and this is manifested in her work that has at times been likened to deconstruction and even “anti-fashion”.

When Kawakubo opened a tiny boutique store in her native Tokyo in 1973, Comme des Garçons was born. Her first show would take place in Paris in 1981 and, like any revolutionary, came with an already devoted following known as the “Crows”, a name that pays testament to Kawakubo’s designs that they wore and adored. The now iconic style centred around a monochrome palette with asymmetrical, oversized and almost deformed cuts that exposed seams and crushed detailing. These were clothes misshapen and distressed yet always elegant. In a single moment Rei Kawakubo took fashion from a medium focused so heavily on sexualised notions of beauty into the abstract.

Kawakubo’s clothing has always been designed to reflect and influence how the individual feels rather than how the clothes look or might be perceived. Her first Comme des Garçons store didn’t even have mirrors. In clear opposition to western norms and conventions, Kawajubos’s powerful statement was shocking at the time and was derogatorily referred to by some as ‘Hiroshima Chic’ and ‘post-atomic’. Now Kawakubo is seen as one of the most important innovators in the history of fashion and her collections continue to provoke and critique. Her approach to design remains enigmatic, stemming from the smallest ideas, images or feelings that are first patterned before being broken down gradually until the collection takes form in a process that allows for such originality in every new collection.

>For something to be beautiful it doesn’t have to be pretty.

But all revolutions are cyclical, and in an age where being “avant-garde” has become almost too easy, Kawakubo’s engagement with the retail side of fashion is equally pioneering. Comme des Garçons now turns over $220 million a year and has over ten lines; all whilst remaining a private company. This has been achieved by the variety of lines, some more business orientated, yet all still kept under a coherent identity. The affordable ready-to-wear line Play, is now one of streetwear’s most ubiquitous features with its iconic heart logo. Likewise the perfumes and zip-wallets combine affordability with quality that many high-fashion houses fail to achieve. Homme Deux focuses primarily on tailoring, discovering a unique clean aesthetic and more formal look through close attention to fit. The unisex line Black could be seen as the ready-to-wear line that most closely fits Kawakubo’s philosophy in breaking down gender specifics to focus on innovative yet affordable design.

In the same year, Kawakubo also unleashed her concept of the Guerilla stores. In five years 37 guerilla shops were opened with non-fashion partners in little known areas of cities all over the world. Lasting only one year, these sparse spaces were isolated in not yet fashionable areas. This refreshing notion of a store took retail back to basics, allowing the products to come to the fore. This innovation has been seen by many to be the inspiration behind the “pop-up store” that is so prevalent in today’s retail. Rei Kawakubo not only changed the way we see clothes - she changed the way we buy them. 

Rei Kawakubo reclusive nature is what actually makes her a maverick in today’s age. Where so often personality overshadows and undermines the actual creations, for Kawakubo whether it’s a new collection, a new line, or even a new store, nothing ever falls flat. Rei Kawakubo has been one of fashion’s greatest revolutionaries and anti-heroes since 1981, but what sets her apart is the constant will and urge to innovate: for Kawakubo, the work is never over.
