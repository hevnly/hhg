In the mid-fifties, a charismatic young dane with a luxuriant fisherman's beard set out on a pilgrimage across Europe in a VW camper. With a pack of cigarettes in one hand and a sharpened pencil in the other, few would have guessed that Verner Panton would become the enfant terrible of Danish furniture design.

If you don't know Panton by name, you'll almost certainly recognise his most celebrated work: The Panton chair (1959). The first chair made from a single piece of plastic, it shook the world and remains one of the greatest manufacturing achievements of the 20th century. ‘It was the holy grail of plastic design' says Deyan Sudjic, director of London's design museum and a fan of Panton.

>He took a material that was previously associated with the cheap and the mass produced and turned it into something that was special and precious.

Curvaceous as a space vixen, merely sitting on a Panton felt out-of-this-world. It became chair of the sixties, continued to scoop up awards in the seventies, was briefly swept away by the synth-pop yuppie-ism of the eighties, and then was rediscovered in the nineties. It even appeared on a now-iconic Vogue cover in 1995 along with a then relatively unknown Kate moss.

Born in 1926 to innkeeper parents in the tiny village gentofte, denmark, Panton was an aspiring artist. During the second world war he joined the resistance – and spent a brief period in hiding after a cache of weapons was discovered in his bedroom. In 1947 he moved to Copenhagen to study architecture, before embarking on a trip around Europe in his beloved VW camper van, which he'd fitted with the bare essentials: a place to sleep and a drawing board. Aside from intermittent hotel pit-stops for hot showers, he designed the first collapsible house (made from cardboard), the first inflatable transparent furniture, played around with new materials, collected the phone numbers of factories he thought might be useful and earned a living from small design projects. Then, in 1959, eager to disrupt the notion that everything danish should be wholesome and crafted from wood, he sketched The Panton chair.

Futuristic, psychedelic, impossibly fluid, it came in seven roaringly-bright colours (everything was mustard yellow in the fifites).  An undulating piece of pop art, it stood out like a screaming toddler at a church wedding. And while it may look like a piece of idiosyncratic sculpture, it was one of the first chairs made to be slouched on. For a while his contemporary, dieter rams, breathed the mantra ‘form follows function', Panton, however, felt that form should follow fun.

As plumes of cigarette smoke curled around Verner Panton's majestic beard, the dane pondered the practicalities of making an un-makeable chair. No danish manufacturer was prepared to produce his experimental design, and the reasons would become depressingly familiar: too risky, too difficult, or simply ‘umulig' (impossible).

It was only when Panton returned to his dog-eared contacts book, assiduously compiled during his camper van years, that Swiss-German company Vitra took up the challenge. A glacial five year development process ensued. but eventually sheer stubbornness – boarding on mania – prevailed.  Armed with a new generation of engineering expertise and new grades of plastic that no longer limited design to traditional forms, Vitra finally put The Panton's masterpiece into production in 1968.

>Verner couldn't stand it when people told him that his designs couldn't be realised but then failed to offer him an alternative solution.

While The Beatles' White album was receiving mixed reviews, The Panton chair landed like an experimental hydrogen bomb.  A trippy reduction of youth culture, it took a sledge-hammer to functionalism and – to use the vernacular – was ‘all kinds of groovy.' As wife Marianne Panton put it after her husband's untimely death in 1998: ‘Verner couldn't stand it when people told him that his designs couldn't be realised but then failed to offer him an alternative solution. After production of the chair, he never again accepted the statement that it can't be done.'

If you'd like to take a closer look, the original now sits in new york's museum of modern art. No need to attempt an oceans eleven-style heist, though, because Vitra's superb 1990s re-issue can be yours from £208 from hevnly.com. Made to Panton's magical proportions, the only difference is that it's made from a more durable plastic, and thus suitable for use outdoors. Or, indeed, in vintage VW camper vans.
