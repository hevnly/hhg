The NikeLab X UNDERCOVER Gyakusou range deftly balances technical innovation and artistic vision to create a functional yet distinctive line of apparel for the discerning runner. The 2015 collection featured cleanly designed, form fitting hoodies and tights in subtle, winter tones. Designer Jun Takahashi is a runner himself, and the practical details this has informed – like lightweight, breathable materials and ample pocketing – are appreciated more with each mile you run in the uniform. UNDERCOVER’s label motto is “We Make Noise, Not Clothes”, and with every instalment of their collaboration with NikeLab having surpassed the last, it’s hard to disagree with that statement. The Gyakusou range is for runners, by runners.

Nike X Concepts Trainer 1.0 “Thermal” was the latest outing from the two long time collaborators and one of the hottest new entrants into the minimal footwear market. Nike’s patented Flywire material moulds the shoe to your foot as you run, and the lightweight and flexible sole provides a true barefoot experience. This limited edition colourway takes inspiration from sports science, with an upper decorated in a bright thermal imaging display and a tongue constructed from heat reactive materials that change colour as you work. The appearance of this model is striking, but the performance is what really sets the shoe apart. The Trainer 1.0 forces you to tighten your technique and up your game.

After two years in the making the Bragi Dash has emerged as one of the most innovative new tech devices, setting new industry standards for fitness products. The Dash is the first truly wireless smart headphone set; boasting function as a standalone music player and live fitness tracker, all with an intuitive touch and swipe interface. And whilst you can use the device as a smartphone companion, the Dash’s functionality otherwise is self-contained, giving you the chance to de-clutter without sacrificing any of your performance metrics. Far from distracting you, the Dash serves to further immerse you in the running experience.

Garmin’s Forerunner 235 GPS watch offers some of the most reliable position tracking around as well as an accelerometer and optical sensor heart rate monitor, making this understated time piece an essential item for those looking to train smarter. Whilst the watch can be synced with multiple devices, it’s another item with standalone utility, meaning you can pare back your gear use and still effectively track your progress. Audio prompts and bright info-graphic readouts inform you of milestones as you run and offer deeper analysis when considered in conjunction with a training log.

The ubiquity of foam rollers in sport recovery is well established but the Rumble Roller stands apart from the crowd. With such a high incidence of injury among runners, most know that a recovery and ‘prehab’ routine is vital to maintain health and optimal body mechanics. The Rumble Roller is an essential piece of the puzzle, featuring firm rubber bumps which mimic the sensation and effect of a massage therapist’s thumbs. By design the roller is firmer than muscle tissue and softer than bone, which leads to myofascial release, rather than mere compression. Deep tissue manipulation relieves pain as well as vastly improving mobility. The Rumble Roller both aids recovery and improves athletic performance, allowing you to sink more hours on the road.
