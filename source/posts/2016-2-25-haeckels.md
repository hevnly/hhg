When JMW Turner proclaimed that, ‘the skies over Thanet are the loveliest in all Europe,’ he was referring to the view of the Isle of Thanet from the town of Margate, Kent, where he painted over a hundred oils and watercolours.

From the 1820s, Turner frequently escaped London to draw inspiration from the seaside town’s breathtaking seascapes. If you get up early enough, you’ll have no problem seeing what the artist meant.

>Haeckel’s to me is about the beauty around us; utilising what's indigenous to create a unique brand with personality.

You might also see a handful of brave figures going about a somewhat peculiar job: combing the beach for seaweed and taking it to a clifftop laboratory.

The Haeckels lab is another powerful testament to Margate and the surrounding area’s natural beauty and vitality. Founded in 2012 by beach warden and film maker, Dom Bridges, the natural fragrance and skincare company holds one of just two licenses issued to harvest seaweed from the English coast. In their bespoke lab, they distil botanicals from that harvest to create a unique line of products. ‘We are farmers,’ Dom tells Hevnly. ‘We’re on the beach nearly every day, up before anyone else.

‘It started with making simple bars of soap for friends as Christmas presents. We soon realised that the idea of turning humble local seaweed into a coveted, natural, vegan soap bar could change perceptions about the coastline, and from there, the business began to blossom.

It was Dom’s wife, Jo, who suggested he acquire a more functional space than the couple’s kitchen to develop his formulae. In 2013, the Cliff Terrace lab became Haeckels’ new headquarters. Since then, the business has expanded to incorporate two sites: a product development lab situated at the back of the Haeckels shop, and a manufacturing lab just a few hundred yards away.

Haeckels’ packaging conveys sleek, minimal design: brown glass, wood and unwaxed cardboard are used to contain the company’s range of all-natural skin, hair and body products, fragrances, and candles. According to Haeckels, ‘the aesthetic of the brand is about presenting our coast in the best way we can, nothing more. We use minimal plastic and no labels: simple products utilising natural ingredients in high volume. Rather than using carriers to bulk out the product, we fill each product with as high percentage of antioxidants as we legally can.’

But why Margate? Margate boasts a fourteen mile long Jurassic chalk reef, which constitutes no less than 20% of all the chalk reefs in the UK. This means that its coast can support an unusual concentration and variety of seaweeds, many of which can’t be found anywhere else in the world. ‘We clean and protect the land like any farmer. Our harvesting sites move in conjunction with seasonal migrations’, ‘The average beach gets six to seven hundred tons of seaweed a year. Our beaches get six to seven thousand. We will never move from Margate - we owe it everything.’   

For the cynic, it’s easy to tar Haeckels with that same, wide brush used to paint the contemporary boom in foraging and natural living as a fad. Does Haeckels represent just that, or does it represent something more?

‘I think it's here to stay,’ Dom responds. ‘It's about people reconnecting with living off the land. We’re all blind to what we have: supermarkets have altered our perception of time - Let's get seasonal, strip back our needs and create new economies within our own countries. Let's get back to true localism and create fresh identities for our towns.’
