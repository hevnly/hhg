In celebration of the upcoming Rio 2016 Olympics, NikeLab turns to acclaimed Louis Vuitton designer Kim Jones. Titled the ‘Packable Sport Style’ collection, this latest collaboration includes a range of light and breathable jackets, t-shirts, shorts and trousers that fold away compactly into small pouches. With practicality and breathability at the centre of the design . The collections seeks to cater to the especially particular needs of the professional athlete on the move. Amidst the colourful capsule collection, classic Nike garments remain at the cross section of innovation, comfort and style. With the understanding that practical compressibility is key, and less is often more when it comes to travelling, Jones applies a subtle approach and seamless construction mechanisms to multi-dyed water-resistant fabrics for an original take on the iconic Windrunner and the all-new Windrunner Top in the roll-up ready iterations. A multifunctional travel bag designed to fit the entire collection and an athlete’s travel essentials completes Jones’s packable approach to NikeLab’s Summer of Sport.
