practicality and luxury should be one and the same. these are the words of oyuna tserendorj, founder of oyuna. after leaving her native mongolia to travel and study, tserendorj settled in london where she began her label in 2002. oyuna aims to connect people with the highest quality of mongolian cashmere and, despite being a relatively young brand, it challenges conceptions of cashmere by combining heritage with a directional design led approach throughout its collections.

mongolian cashmere has a rich and ancient history. it has been manufactured on the harsh steppes for thousands of years and today the country is the second largest exporter of the raw material. tserendorj addresses this heritage by channeling the ingenuity of mongolian nomads through her creative and innovative approach to the material. while many large european cashmere brands tend to use cashmere in soft, conventional designs, oyuna replicates the daring spirit of nomadic communities by creating architecturally surprising cuts and colourful finishes throughout her womenswear collections.

for oyuna, trends are inconsequential. tserendorj says she admires designers who have a distinct point of view that they continue to express regardless of fleeting fashion crazes. for inspiration, she turns away from catwalks and towards timeless designs in product or in architecture. for each new collection, tserendorj and her team decide upon a couple of what she terms ‘core stories’ – common themes that unite the pieces. these stories, she says, are often inspired by something seemingly inconsequential: a small detail on a particular building could inform a pleated structure that translates across everything from dresses to bags. this approach gives oyuna’s clothing the feel of being simultaneously classic and fiercely modern.

the cashmere in oyuna’s collections does not revolve solely around the delicate pastels commonly associated with the material. tserendorj says that while cashmere will always be beautiful in tones of ivory, taupe and black, she wants to push the limits of the fabric to bring vibrancy to outfits and homes. in the aw15 womenswear collection, amongst the navy and black expected from this seasonal offering, a bright yellow coat and flashes of mint green appear. oyuna achieves this strength of colour through a meticulously considered process: natural swiss dyes are applying to the fibres directly, before they are even spun into yarn.

this philosophy of investigation into the medium of cashmere extends to the annual home & accessories collection. for oyuna, collaboration is at the heart of aiding this experimental process. at last year’s london design festival, the label invited three renowned design practices to work with a classic oyuna product and bring their own perspectives to the fabric. hunting & narud, study o portable, and peter marigold typically work with hard woods and industrial grade materials, but with oyuna’s expertise could create unexpected cashmere pieces. the results from the collaboration were remarkable: binary code inspired knitting techniques and rust stains provided unusual pattering on a neutral throw. tserendorj believes that this type of collective working helps the brand to retain its fresh and unique perspective on cashmere.

this year oyuna launched a capsule menswear collection, consisting of six essential pieces for men. it was conceived as this missing piece in the oyuna lifestyle package, giving men the same chance to experience their inimitable blend of form and function. those seeking a fully-fledged menswear collection will have to wait however: next year oyuna will revisit another capsule collection, but the primary focus will be on making the womenswear and home offerings increasingly dynamic and cohesive. there will always be a surfeit of luxury cashmere labels, but few can offer the same level of integrity and respect for the material as oyuna.
