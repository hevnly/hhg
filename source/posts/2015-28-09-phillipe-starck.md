As humanity speeds ever quicker down the path of progress, many urgently feel we must take our foot off the accelerator or risk hitting the wall of our limitations. Amongst those intimately concerned with this plight is Parisian design mogul, Philippe Starck.

Born of painter, Jacqueline Lanourisse, and aeronautics engineer, André Starck – a designer in his own right who we can thank for both lipstick tubes and non-slip coating – Philippe Starck is known around the world for a vast and varied conquests in the design world including; the surreal Vitra ‘W.W. stool’, the functional yet stylish Parrot ‘Zik’ headphones, toothpicks, spaceships, lemon squeezers, and even a French presidential home (the desk for which he designed from a dream). He has also put his name to a number of iconic architectural pieces such as the infamous ‘LA Flamme’ Asahi brewery, the anthropomorphic 'Nani Nani' building in Tokyo, and more recently a series of super-green homes that create 50% more energy than they use.

Starck has always tended toward juxtaposing elements in his work; from unusual material components, such as velvet with chrome or glass with stone, through to humorous mixtures of traditional and modern. His designs are often curved, feminine shapes and he makes use of modern materials and technological processes to realise his flowing visions. A perfect example of this style is the tongue-in-cheek ‘Louis Ghost Chair’. Drawing on the centuries-old aesthetic, Starck has updated the material aspect by using translucent injection-moulded plastic. This in turn allowed him to extend the leg of the chair and add a playful, modern twist to revitalise this timeless piece.

Throughout the 80s and 90s Starck’s style was described by some as ‘overdesigned’, although Starck has argued that his approach to design appropriately mirrored this period of socio-economic frivolity.

>With over forty years of experience and now well into his sixties, Starck’s prolific career is a long way from over

He is still one of the most influential and sought-after design figures ever to emerge from paris – no small feat in a metropolis renowned for its ceaseless contribution to aesthetic elegance. However, it is exactly against this backdrop that Philippe Starck’s silhouette is still so prominent today.

Since the turn of the century his tastes have matured greatly but Starck now sees his work in design as inherently ‘useless’. This is not meant as a personal slur per se but rather a general feeling that twenty-first century designers do little to benefit humankind. This may seem rash, a cursory look around you at this very moment will most-likely provide ample evidence of just how much the design world has given humanity. Indeed Starck’s favourite ‘designers’, Leonardo Da Vinci and Eratosthenes – the latter who in 205bc measured the circumference of the world with only a two per cent error using a camel, a well and a wooden stick thirty centimetres long – are considered massive contributors to human progress.

To better understand his perspective we must first grasp Starck’s three conceptions of design; ‘cynical design’ – design for purely aesthetic purposes, ‘narcissistic design’ – high design for the affluent few, and ‘profitable design’ – invention that addresses real human problems. Starck believes most modern designers are operating in the two former camps and he aspires to work within in this final category. Preferring usability over aesthetics Philippe Starck appears to be on a humanistic, almost existential quest to prove his own worth in the story of mankind – or as he more poetically calls it – ‘The Big Image’.

Starck has championed this ethical position since the beginnings of his career. Whilst still at the tender age of seventeen, Starck found himself working in Pierre Cardin’s publishing house, but the two quickly came to a head over their differing philosophical outlooks. ‘My idea was to make a million chairs at $1, and his idea was to make one chair at $1 million. so i left after three months.’ His self-belief and uncompromising determination soon took him from employee to employer, and he began his own design company, ‘Starck Products’ in 1979 – later re-named ‘Ubik’ after a science-fiction novel by american writer, Philip K. Dick. Starck posits ‘clear logic, clear ethics, clear creativity’ as the only secret to the company’s global success.

Despite a career of many collaborations, Starck talks openly about his preference to work alone and his affinity with working naked. He tries to spend most of his time in seclusion and considers himself a ‘modern monk.’ However, if his environment seems peaceful and removed, his approach to work on the other hand is entirely the opposite. ‘I work three hours, sleep 45 minutes, work three hours, sleep 45 minutes, for 24 hours, without eating. It’s a little sick. But i’m like Dr. Faust. I signed a contract with the devil to sell my life for creativity.’

A great deal of his more-recent works are inspired by the way organic processes can better human technologies – Starck calls this principle, ‘bionism’. For example, his 2010 project ‘Starck Eyes’, a range of reading glasses, featured a biolink hinge: A patented micro-articulation modelled on the human clavicle which offer the arms multi-directional freedom and are therefore less likely to break. Starck feels that ‘creativity is light’ and the business model he uses for his design houses is based around a natural principle called ‘Degrowth’.

>The overall trend is towards degrowth, like society. in physics the volume always decreases as density rises, and i try to do the same. I grow back deliberately, increasing my density

Starck’s attitude toward his life and his work has a quintessential creative allure, synthesising both the moody and the playful, the scientific and the intuitive, a nostalgia for the past and an excitement for the future. Despite his global success, Starck has no intention of leaving a legacy – he just wishes to leave ‘white pages’ for generations to come. In a recent ted talk he impressed upon the audience the miracle of human progress – from bacteria to blackberry in 4 billion years – at each stage blissfully unaware of what we would later become. Starck’s message is uplifting and empowering, every individual has a duty to contribute to our great story – ‘How we decide to shape the future … that is our poetry.’
