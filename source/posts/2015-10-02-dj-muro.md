takayoshi murota – more commonly known as ‘dj muro’ – could not greater exemplify the contemporary thirst for retrospective re-discovery and hybrid creativity. it was in the early nineties that muro first encountered the true vibrancy of hip-hop culture in harajuku hokoten, a ‘pedestrian paradise’ close to his home in the suburbs north of tokyo.

turntablists, break-dancers and graffiti artist were all harmoniously integrated in this open and inclusive space, a world away from the popular introspective nature of japan’s heavy metal era. it was at these street parties that muro would meet his long-time friend and collaborator ‘dj krush’. from carrying his records he soon became an indispensable member of krush’s crew, ‘krush posse’ and the pair immediately began a friendly-competitive exchange of records. from copying rented ‘africa bambaataa’ and ‘grandmaster flash’ vinyls to tape in his teens and more recently fusing hip-hop breaks with west african records from the 60’s and 70’s.

>his compilations are characterized by impeccable mixing, great selections and a true b-boy aesthetic, real mixtapes rather than compiled songs with silence in between.

‘crate digging’ is rarely talked of formally but, understanding it’s importance not just to hip-hop but to the creative process of all new music today, muro has consciously put himself at its forefront. at the centre of his work is a call to action for music-lovers to explore their local record stores and dive deeper into their musical tastes.

>muro’s ability to source and sample obscure records has further earned him the title, ‘king of diggin’.

at krush’s suggestion muro branched out into rap as well as dj-ing. his mumbling style was inspired by his grandfather, a kannushi [shinto priest]. his early morning chants used four-lettered kanji idioms as metaphors and impressed upon him the depth of expression available in the japanese language. despite his passion for the language both muro and krush, like their american contemporaries, were more interested in form rather than content and used japanese as a tool to create complex flows.

hip-hop’s influence on muro did not stop at the music. in 2010 muro published a book called ’45rpm cover museum’, a curation of his favourite vinyl sleeves. muro cites african-american artist ‘ernie barnes’ as creating amongst his favourite covers but, inspired by the continued spread of the subculture throughout japan, muro also favoured records with traditional katakana syllabary. initially the inscriptions were all drawn by hand and, with no regular font sets, each record possessed it’s own idiosyncrasies. he also recalls the translations being a source of great amusement for him.

furthermore muro has started various limited collaborations with designer brands such as timberland, adidas, new era and stussy to name but a few. these have ranged from clothing and shoes to hats and other accessories, all stamped with muro’s green and red tartan signature. fusing the many elements of american hip-hop with japanese culture and his own ambitious personality dj muro has helped establish an on-going dialogue between japan and hip-hop. a conversation he continues to facilitate to this day and will no doubt contribute to further in time to come.
