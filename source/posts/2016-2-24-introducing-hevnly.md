For Badé Fatona, there is a serious problem with today’s e-commerce culture. Many have felt it; mindless perusal on a page of endless products, waiting for yet another page to load, the scrolling tab becoming ever smaller.

'As a consumer, these platforms can tell me what I’m buying, when I bought it and when it’s being delivered - but it can’t tell me what else I might like,' says Badé.

>hevnly’s aim is to promote a meaningful connection between man and material.

He evokes the old saying - if it ain't broke, don’t fix it - yet strongly asserts that ecommerce, is in fact, broken.

The concept of hevnly was born out of his search for a sensitive, tailored, online retail experience rather than spewing forth a range of products. The philosophy behind the name is simple yet invigorating. With individuality at the center of its ethos, hevnly is a portal offering high-quality fashion products that one would not encounter in the everyday.

These products are severed from ‘what’s in’ or ‘what’s hot’, offering only special items that help individuals develop their own personal style. Badé envisions hevnly as a revered style-bible for people with selective taste, heralding the platform’s tagline – ‘The Holy Grail Of Style’.

hevnly provides a trinity of media: the website, the mobile app and the magazine.

The website will seek to revolutionize the way people shop online by offering a carefully-curated shopping experience. Once someone creates a profile, hevnly puts only relevant products in front of them.

Understanding the rush of modern life, Badé prioritizes convenience of purchase. Buying has never been easier and can be achieved in just three clicks through hevnly’s app.

'Uber, airbnb, everything is done on mobile,' he says, 'but no-one has done mobile shopping properly.' He maintains the hevnly app is still a premium experience despite being quick, easy and fun to use.

The magazine is the body of hevnly. It is the personification of how hevnly thinks about culture, fashion and lifestyle. Expect intimate stories behind London’s most innovative people, places and products.

All three applications work to help brands tell their story, something which Badé views as essential. And like these products, hevnly has its own story.

After working in New York as an oil trader, Badé sought to realise his dream of revolutionising fashion commerce in 2012. The young entrepreneur has experienced the same difficulty that plagues most start-ups - the vote of confidence. He says that people can be myopic when it comes to new things, but once he presents anyone with something visually tangible, their imaginations are set alight.

Ultimately, his dream is to have hevnly revered as an internationally renowned destination synonymous with quality and style. He believes that the platform will achieve this because fundamentally, it is about offering high-quality, high integrity products that are supported by inspirational individuals with real stories.

hevnly’s mission is to elevate products with a truly positive force behind their conception. A force which truly deserves to permeate our everyday lives.
