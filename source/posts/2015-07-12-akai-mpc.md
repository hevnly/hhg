In 1988 a man named Roger Linn took his innovative designs for a sampling sequencer to the Japanese company Akai. The resulting partnership would create something that has been as influential to hip-hop as any of the great producers or MC’s - that “something” was the Akai Midi Production Center

The original Akai MPC60 may not look like a world-beater but in combining a sampler with a drum machine digital samples could truly become the core of composition. This removed unnecessary technicalities and streamlined the process of making tracks. The 16 tactile square finger pads also gave the MPC a physical straightforwardness that allowed creative sampling of sounds to be easily matched with rhythmical precision. In this sense the Akai perfectly complements the artisanal nature of hip-hop where the materials can be made out of literally any music or recorded sound to then be forged together into a beat or track.

The simplicity of the Akai MPC is reflected in its timeless appeal. DJ Premier, one of hip-hops greatest producers, has been using the same MPC 60-II (released in 1991) throughout his career. And the MPC is not just essential to beatmaking but also, increasingly, in live performance. From DJ Shadow to RJD2, the tactile nature of the pads adds a punch that is unmistakably that of hip-hop’s early days. And yet, the Akai MPC goes beyond the sound of the so called “golden age”. This was seen with Kanye’s performances of Runaway at the MTV Awards and later tours where he utilized the MPC. This payed homage to the early forms of sampling whilst also adding to a powerfully minimalist performance in the slow building of a beat with just a few taps on a nondescript machine.

This merging of hardware’s physical element of play with software’s digital composing shows how  the synth styles of contemporary hip-hop can take from the tradition that came before. Even Jamie XX prefers the controller for his live shows to get the crisper sounds and variety that is lost with live drums. With the most recent model, the ‘Touch’, released this year; there can be no doubt that the MPC is here to stay.

And if there can be one reason for such longevity, especially in an industry with constant technological advancement, it is the ability to combine sample sequencing with the natural imperfections of live playing. This is seen with so many producers but the one that stands above the rest is J Dilla. Seen by many as the most talented hip-hop producer the world ever heard; Dilla’s underlying off-beat rhythms where what gave his production the texture and character that has cemented his reputation since his premature death in 2006. This effect was not created through complex and minute technological adjustments (like those constantly suggested in beatmaking forums by others desperately trying to emulate his style) but by simply going back to basics, playing beats live and unquantized - on his trusty Akai MPC.

Whilst the MPC is still used to create beats, it has also gone further, becoming an instrument in its own right. Newer models of increasing affordability mean that musicians can explore and experiment with the Akai MPC alongside other aspects of their craft. The beauty of the MPC is essentially that it makes an instrument out of any sound, from the sampling of 70’s soul tracks for classic hip-hop instrumentals, to the growing scene of ‘sound collage’ or ‘found sound’ experimental artists who utilize the everyday sounds that go unnoticed. Infinite resources matched with such a straightforward and tactile output streamlines production like no other machine, software program or instrument can. The Akai MPC is truly what you make of it.
