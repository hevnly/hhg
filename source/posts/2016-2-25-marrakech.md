Morocco, or as it’s known in Arabic - “The Kingdom Of The West” - is a country characterised by its rugged mountains, distinctive blend of cultures and hugely rich history. A country that some of the greatest empires called home; from the Romans, to the Vandals and Visigoths, and later the great Berber Dynasties. Now, in a new chapter of its history, “The Kingdom” is fast becoming the destination of choice for many Europeans.

Marrakech is Morocco’s best known city. Yves Saint Laurent fell in love with the city, and it soon became his second home. His old residence - the Majorelle Garden designed by the painter Jacques Majorelle in 1926 - is now a popular destination for sightseers, and also houses the Islamic Art Museum of Marrakech.

From the city’s main square, Jemaa el-Fnaa (still populated with storytellers and snake charmers, as it was hundreds of years ago) you are enticed into the rabbit warren of surrounding souks. This seemingly endless labyrinth yields a myriad of offerings from traditional textiles and local spices, to high-quality leather goods and exotic animals.

At night, Jemaa el-Fnaa really comes alive; smoke, rich with the textures and scents of Moroccan cuisine, fills the air as the square is transformed into an open air restaurant. For a vague assurance of quality, it is best to seat yourself at a stall where the locals congregate. If you're an adventurous eater, the mutton stalls in the centre of the maylay are well worth a visit for their sheep's brain and skewered heart.

Aside from the colourful, winding passages of the Medina, there are many other ways to take in the city. The Maison de la Photographie houses over 4,500 photographs dedicated to the city’s Berbers, and provides an extensive account of Marrakech’s history, as well as possessing perhaps the finest view of the city from it’s rooftop café. The “Daughter Of The Desert” is also home to a number of superb contemporary spaces such as the David Bloch Gallery, where traditional styles meet graffiti-inspired modernism.

George Orwell once wrote how foreigners flocked to Marrakech in search of “Camels, Castles, Palm Trees, Foreign Legionaries, Brass Trays and Bandits.” Thankfully the latter are mostly a thing of the past, but more than ever the tourists come, bringing great wealth with them. This influx of capital has led to the building of luxurious hotels; of note is La Mamounia and the Royal Mansour, now almost 100 years old and home to the finest hammam you’re likely to come across.

But Marrakech's true wealth lies in its’ people. With its ever-growing community of artists, musicians, and tech startups, whether it's traditional or modern you are looking for, the “Land Of God” never fails to deliver.
