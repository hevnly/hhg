A series of black and white monotype prints hang in a row, framed on a white wall. They look like a series of abstract pieces: black surfaces erratically erased. They look, from a distance, like seven versions of chaos.

*[display gallery](http://displaygallery.co.uk/) – ‘How to appear without a trace’ – 5.6.15.*

Take a step forward: a detail emerges in Nicole Coson’s work. It resembles an eye, ghostly and disembodied. Look closer and other details reveal themselves. An ear lobe, a nostril, the curvature of a smile: the contours of a face. Chaos, disorder and confusion begin to take a definite form. Nicole uses an etching press and a technique called monotype printmaking to produce her unsettling works. Before getting underway, though, it’s important to create the right ambience: "I like to listen to 19th century piano compositions before and during my process…producing the work involves a lot of heavy machinery and therefore I use it to keep calm and focused…Franz Lizst is a favourite of mine".

*A collage of ‘ghosts of human likeness’.*

Once she’s ready, she starts with a plate of metal on which she lays an even coat of black ink. She then uses her fingers and scraps of cloth to wipe away the ink. Slowly, with the help of solutions like white spirit, an image appears. She then places the plate through an etching press with a piece of paper on top of it, using 3,000 pounds of pressure per square inch to transfer the image on the plate to the paper. This is known as a reductive process. In contrast to painting, for example, where the painter adds layers of paint to the canvas, the printmaker removes material, steadily erasing what was originally there.

*‘Suddenly finding myself in London was an intense experience that definitely made me question and realise a lot of things about myself’.*

It’s a technique appropriate to Nicole’s subject matter. The majority of her monotype prints resemble ghostly portraits, figures that are both there and not there, hovering uncertainly between corporeality and the spectral. Coson’s pieces avoid recognisable referents, making the viewing experience an intensely subjective one: it’s up to the viewer to make sense of the work. In this respect, Coson uses her tools unconventionally. The old printing machinery she works with had been used to produce newspapers and other forms of printed material that aimed to establish clear communication and stable meanings. Coson’s monotypes, in contrast, work like rorschach tests: different people see different images.

>Her work is loosely modelled on the encantadas, spiritual creatures and monsters from Filipino folklore.

Coson cites the rorschach test as an important influence on her work. other influences, though, are more personal. Born and raised in Manila, Philippines, and came to London to study fine art when she was seventeen years old. It was a daunting and disorientating journey. "I think moving from Manila at seventeen and suddenly finding myself in London was an intense experience that definitely made me question and realise a lot of things about myself which i sometimes incorporate into my practice."

*‘The internet satisfies furious appetites for art but it also definitely hinders the real experience of it all’.*

Coson learned the technique of monotype printmaking at central saint martins (where she graduated in 2014). It arose out of necessity: dissatisfied with the space available for painters, she took to the printmaking workshops in the Old Byam Shaw site. It was here that she began experimenting with prints, starting with a spoon, watercolour and some acrylic. She took what she knew from her studies in painting and applied them to monotype printmaking. While her methods have evolved and developed in their sophistication, she estimates that she is unsatisfied with 70% of the work she produces.

>I select the work that I feel communicates my intentions the best… the works seen in the shows are the tip of the iceberg of the actual works produced.

Coson’s site offers a good insight into the range of her work. but she has some reservations about the current relationship between art and the internet. "The internet is an interesting topic right now… it’s definitely changed the way people view art… on the one hand,"" she explains, "people have access to such a vast number of artworks from nearly all galleries across the world but, on the other, it doesn’t really seem like limitless access when you’re looking at it from your 15-inch macbook screen." The internet, Coson adds, ‘satisfies furious appetites for art but it also definitely hinders the real experience of it all.’ Her own work is a perfect testament to this claim. Coson’s teasingly suggestive pieces are most captivating when seen in their physical form and not least because the monotypes emphasise their own materiality. They show fingerprints, signs of deterioration, and subtle textures that highlight the working process.

No electronic display can reproduce the experience of seeing one of her pieces for the first time. Computer screens often play tricks on the human eye but Coson’s prints are unsettling because they morph, shift and exist as several images at once, while physically remaining there, as ink on paper, fixed. It’s easy to take for granted the physical, material element of the monotypes when viewing them as digital reproductions. And it’s easy to forget that they are records of a singular, chance event: Coson manipulates the material on the plate but she has limited control over the final image that comes out of the press. Even the more controlled manipulation process contains an unpredictability to it since she uses a variety of additives that make the ink move in unforeseeable ways. The monotypes are as much documents of contingency as they are haunting depictions of ghostly figures.

*Coson’s pieces avoid recognisable referents, making the viewing experience an intensely subjective one.*

Coson has had two solo exhibitions in Manila, one in Rome and, most recently, an exhibition at the display gallery in London, where her show, how to appear without a trace, included newer works that incorporated materials such as linen, perspex and wool. What’s next for Coson? "I have yearly goals, to keep me going… now that I’ve done my first solo show in London, I’m hoping to land more chances to exhibit on more familiar soil, around Asia". Let’s just hope she reappears very quickly.
