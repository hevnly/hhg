‘I’ve always been more arty- I was never really that interested in sport!’ Adelle Tracy laughs. Relaxed, confident and beaming, the rising running star is patiently going through her morning’s session: ‘today I had more of a speed session. I had a 500m time trial- pretty much flat out- and a couple of short recovery reps, which is where you don’t let yourself recover fully before going again. Today it’s not a nice day outside- it’s really cold. I had quite a hard session, but you have to be able to switch off and go through the motions. Once you’re done its actually really satisfying.’

It’s another day at the office for the Olympic 800m hopeful, whose rigourous routine means that most days begin with training at eight in the morning; unless she’s working, in which case she starts at five thirty. She limits herself to between five and six miles a day, and eight miles on a Sunday. In total, she runs about two marathons a week. ‘Everything I do,’ Adelle points out, ‘fits around my training.’

*'As my running got better, everything else seemed to get better too.’*

Adelle’s foray into athletics began at a young age: at 12 she joined local athletics club Guildford and Godalming AC. At 15 she won her first national title and began specializing in the 800m. At 16 she donned her first Great Britain vest and became a European Youth Olympic silver medallist. She was later invited to two-time Olympic gold medallist Dame Kelly Holmes’ own specialist training camp, before being nominated by Holmes herself to light the Olympic cauldron in London in 2012.

The current goal is a place on the starting line at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, but Adelle refuses to let the vision of that grandeur divert her focus from the job in hand: ‘it’s about working two energy systems,’ she tells me. ‘The funny thing about 800m is that it’s speed endurance… That’s why I like it so much- it’s really interesting in that respect. The race itself is so tactical; there’s not a lot of time for error as it’s still quite quick.’ Her personal best currently stands at 2:01.01, a time that will easily qualify her for the Olympics if she can repeat that performance when it counts. She is far from resting on her laurels though: ‘Even if you’ve run the required time, you still need to run that time twice and get an automatic qualifying position to know that you’re definitely going.

>it’s just a case of being consistent and running your own race.

Being a high profile athlete in 2016 is about much more than just what happens on the track, though. Social media, for instance, plays a predictably important role. ‘The way I give back to sponsors is by ‘Tweeting’, ‘Instagramming’… letting people know what I’m doing. That’s something I learnt a lot about from being on camp with Kelly actually- they helped with media training: how to be wise on social media and not say inappropriate things. I think it’s really important because a lot of people don’t know about that kind of stuff.’

Now a model for Nike, Adelle is determined to use her increasing status in the best possible way. ‘I’ve been doing sportswear and fitness modeling for three or four years. It’s nice because there’s very much an emphasis on female empowerment. They don’t want models who are really lean- they want women to aspire to be athletic and healthy. A lot of women will be thinking ‘I don’t want to go to the gym because I don’t want to get really muscular’, but these campaigns promote a healthier outlook on the athletic figure. I do like the ethos with Nike women, because sport in general is so male dominated- it promotes the women’s side of sport as well, and portrays them in a very athletic and raw way, where we do sweat, and it’s not all pretty. It brings a much more realistic side to it…’

*Empowerment is a key aspect of the Nike Women's ethos*

It would seem that Adelle Tracy is tearing down the home straight to yet another benchmark in her prodigious career. ‘Women’s running can only become more popular with the Olympics in Rio,’ she says excitedly, and suffice to say the 2016 Games will surely inspire yet another generation of athletes. ‘Even just being at the Olympic stadium, knowing that I’ve got there, would be really satisfying,’ she envisages. It all testifies to the sturdy, central philosophy embedded in the rising star’s career: I think the most important thing is just to focus on you and what you can do, and allowing that belief to carry you through. ’
