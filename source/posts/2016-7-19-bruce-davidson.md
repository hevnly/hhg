American Photographer Bruce Davidson, a long time member of the Magnum Photos agency, is one of the most accomplished photographers of his generation and one of the new wave documentary pioneers of the early 1960s that included Danny Lyon and Lee Friedlander.

Known for his work amongst some of the most alienated communities in society, his images always challenged and illuminated. "Brooklyn Gang" perhaps best demonstrates this. Upon hearing about street fights between rival gangs in Brooklyn, Davidson quickly traveled to the epicenter of the trouble and encountered The Jokers, a gang of teenage New Yorkers who came to be the focus of his work. While with The Jokers the line between observing photographer and participant became blurred as he followed them from Prospect Park to Coney Island and everything in-between. "In time they allowed me to witness their fear, depression and anger," he wrote. "I soon realised that I, too, was feeling their pain. In staying close to them, I uncovered my own feelings of failure, frustration and rage." His time with The Jokers has become one of the seminal records of post war American youth culture.

His work “Time of Change” which followed the Civil Rights Movement and Freedom Riders around the United States saw him awarded the National Endowment for the Arts grant - a first for a photographer. Speaking on his work he said  "I made a decision early on not to buy a telephoto lens, to never be more than a metre and a half from the protesters and the policemen I was photographing on the streets. I wanted to be almost in the picture." His work in this series still feels crucial and essential, perhaps now more than ever.

*Young men joined the march from the Selma to Montgomery, Ala., organized by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in March 1965.*

>All the time I was witnessing that struggle, I felt I was part of something, not apart from it.

Perhaps his most Famous book “East 100th Street” in which he photographed an infamously run-down block in East Harlem showcases the best qualities of his work. His ability to become a part of the community yielded intensely intimate work that captured inner-city ghetto life like never before. Speaking on the work he has acknowledged its significance "That book made a difference, though. I went back years later to photograph the positive changes and a woman who had been an activist there in the 1970s told me that when the people in power saw the book, heads rolled. It caused a shake-up and the good effects filtered down to the community."
