AMH (Ashley Marc Hovel) a Berlin based contemporary menswear line launched in 2009, carries the initials of the designers name and is concentrated on premium streetwear. Drawing from the Creative Directors own experiences, in work and life, to design a collection that is inspired by the past yet conscious of the present and future.

The SS16 collection titled - WIN | LOSE, takes inspiration from Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson's 1992 cult classic “White Men Can’t Jump”. Focusing on men’s jersey wear with vivid patterns, contrasting prints and embroidery. HHG takes to the backstreets of London’s China town to look at the latest collection.
