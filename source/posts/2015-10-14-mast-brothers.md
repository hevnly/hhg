"Not everything strange and unfamiliar is transcendental". Rothko isn't usually understood or agreed with, but having recently seen an exhibition of his, it seems his message might be something like this; we, as a culture have forgotten how to connect to our, basic and primal, human universality. We've forgotten to embrace those feelings that are so visceral that no words can articulate the sensations that they rouse in us. So much so that the beauty of quiet simplicity has been forgotten but Rick and Michael Mast have done something about that.

*Attention to detail from bean to bar*

Rothko might have had a point; that old and familiar can sometimes be better. The founders of Mast Brothers have rediscovered a timeless medium that allows us to embrace that elusive moment of tranquil silence and combine Rothko's musing with our natural desire to further our selves. Of warmth and reflection. Of contentedness and curiosity. Of memory and inception. The medium; chocolate. What really strikes one is the brothers' attention to detail. From every single ingredient chosen, to the hand wrapping of each individual bar with thick, old fashioned paper. The duo are restoring an old printing press so that they can design and produce their own in-house wrapping paper using traditional printing methods. They even believed that sailing their cocoa beans over from each of their countries of origin would effect the creative process.

>What really strikes is the brothers attention to detail

Two shops exist, each equipped with it's own in-house chocolate factory, the first in Brooklyn and now also in London. The process of creation is, as expected, littered with fine detail and nuance. To begin with the most beautiful and dynamic cocoa beans are sourced from all over the world and sailed over to the mast factories. The beans are then sorted by hand and given a specific roasting profile, which can take the brothers weeks to accomplish. At this stage the beans are ready to be roasted in bunches of 10-12 lbs. They're roasted not by conventional methods but by convection, which allows more control to be implemented throughout the cooking process. Once cooked the shells are removed with a winnowing machine leaving the cocoa nibs ready to be ground. At this stage tasting as they go is of the utmost importance. Cane sugar, maple sugar and birch sugar are added. once the stone grinding is finished and the flavours are balanced, the chocolate is separated into 10lb blocks and set. It's then wrapped up and aged for no less than thirty days. Finally, the aged chocolate is made malleable enough to mould and set before being exquisitely hand wrapped.

The plethora of flavours offer a plain country of origin bar; Belize, Tanzania, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Madagascar, Papua New Guinea and Peru. Before concept flavours such as vanilla and smoke, black truffle, and serrano pepper are explored. Classics like sea salt, chilli, coffee and hazelnut are also all available. And for the dairy conscious amongst us sheep, cow and goat milk are all offered too. They even use the chocolate coated drums to brew chocolate tea and beer.

>They believe that their chocolate is more than just chocolate. It's an experience

In a world where mass distribution and numbing commerciality is the goal, Rick and Michael mast must be applauded for their values. They believe that their chocolate is more than just chocolate. It's an experience. An opportunity to reconnect with a childlike curiosity that we regularly forget to indulge in. Sometimes we forget to take the time to be still with ourselves and to connect with our senses and feelings. and what the Mast Brothers have offered is a chance to do just that.


The refreshing attitude of the introspective brothers, who say that they know they're onto something good when a new idea makes them scared and nervous, is inspiring. "We just yearn for that next step!" they say. Imagine a world where more businesses held similarly noble principles and philosophies and followed the Mast Brother's idealism in gracefully producing tailored, elegant and individual work.

That same individualistic concept of the emmersonian spirit is something that the mast brothers profess to hold in high esteem and a concept that they hope they can articulate through their thoughtfully and delicately crafted chocolate. Ralph Waldo Emerson, the leader of the transcendentalist movement of the 1800's, once wrote; "I have only one doctrine. The infinitude of the private man". We too often disregard that natural capacity within ourselves. We should be celebrating our natural ability to dream and to fantasise and to lose ourselves in a moment of velvety nostalgia. As Michael, the younger of the two mast brothers, contemplates; "you only get one shot at this life. So make it a voyage. an adventure. something beautiful".
