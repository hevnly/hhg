There are sunglasses, Sunglasses - Noun: Glass tinted to protect the eyes from sunlight or glare. Then there are Gentle Monster Sunglasses - Noun: A designer eyewear label that constantly develops itself under a philosophy of "innovational high-end experiments". In other words, this is no ordinary eyewear. Pioneering South Korean "optics lab" Gentle Monster designs eyewear with a frankensteinian approach - crafting a range of dynamic, eye-catching optical wear in the true spirit of innovation. They say that the "eyes are the window to the soul" - in this editorial, hevnly takes a material and experimental approach to this concept. Set against the backdrop of New York City - by donning a pair of the design studio's creations, each individual channels their inner monster and vicariously the spirit of the city they inhabit. hevnly presents the "Gentle Monsters of New York"
