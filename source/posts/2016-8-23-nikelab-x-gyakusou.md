In celebration of the Rio Olympics, Nike and Jun Takahashi’s UNDERCOVER once again combine to create another unique NikeLab Gyakusou collection. The latest chapter of the on-going Gyakusou collaboration unfolds with vibrant expression inspired by Rio de Janeiro.

*Undercover founder
and designer Jun Takahashi embraces a bright palette to create new
uniforms for the modern runner.*



Unlike previous collections, which make a stronger use of more usual muted colours, the “Rio in Reverse” capsule collection is comparatively unfamiliar, opting for a brighter, more vibrant colour tone emblematic of Brazil. The uncharacteristic use of bright colours and splashes of neon intend to capture the vibrancy of Rio de Janeiro. Featuring pieces inspired by elite distance runners, this collection certainly  isn’t short of functional and technical advances. All pieces implement Dri-FIT technology, while the Distant Short utilizes a light and breathable FlyVent waistband and also features a foldable back pocket on the rear panel for extra garment storage.

*The performance apparel and footwear adhere to the
Gyakusou principle of distraction-free running.*
