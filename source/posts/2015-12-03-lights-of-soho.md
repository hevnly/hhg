london’s soho used to be notorious. the seedy centre of the city’s sex industry, where artists and bohemians drank and danced in underground bars and cafés, and where bright and flashing neon signs illuminated the dirty streets. but today the area is best known for its upmarket restaurants, fashionable bars, and high-end clothing stores. gone are the artists, gone are the bohemians, and gone are the lights—or, at least, most of them. soho, it’s understood, has changed.

*‘signs that say what you want them to say’ guest-curated by robert montgomery*

lights of soho wants to change all that. designed as a space to exhibit neon and light-based artwork, the gallery and member’s lounge opened on brewer street earlier this year. as hamish jenkinson, co-founder of lights of soho, explains, the gallery space is in fact a ‘response’ to both past and present soho. ‘neon,’ he says, ‘has such a rich history in soho that it only seemed natural to bring a neon art gallery to the neighbourhood.’ it could have been seen as another nail in the coffin, another trendy establishment trading off the area’s famous past. but the gallery isn’t just about commemorating soho’s visual history – what soho used to be, what, in other words, soho isn’t anymore – it’s also about fostering a ‘cultural hub for soho’s creative community’, promoting all types of neon and light-based artists. what makes lights of soho different, however, is the fact that it functions as a public gallery in the day and becomes a member’s lounge at night (artists are encouraged to apply for free art memberships).

>alongside creating a successful light art gallery we want to build a community and that community is as important to us as the gallery is

lights of soho’s upcoming exhibition, an open submissions show, ‘signs that say what you want them to say’, is a testament to this desire to create a community. the show, hamish insists, ‘is a window of opportunity for young artists to get involved in the art scene… with this show, i’m hoping that we can reach artists who are well into their craft or just discovering it.’ he’s keen to show young artists that ‘art is a democratic experience’ and that they too can be featured in a london gallery. importantly, it’s this kind of initiative, hamish believes, that sets lights of soho apart from other nearby galleries, which ‘don’t offer [open submissions] because they’re in it for the money’. the emphasis on artist inclusivity, he says, ‘only adds to the community that we’re trying to build: we want artists – no matter who they are – to be involved and be a part of our story.’

while artists will be able to get complimentary membership, others can pay for the benefits that a membership brings. these include invitations to special events, priority table bookings, an art discount of 5% off all shows (excluding special commissions), four non-member guest passes at any one time, and special rates for private venue hire. at a time when, according to hamish, ‘other members’ bars are starting to feel like hotel chains,’ it seems like good value for money, working out at just over £12 per month for under 27s and around £16 per month for everyone else.

a membership for lights of soho is especially good value if you consider how impressive the space inside is. intricate, colourful neon works—produced by established artists like chris bracey (god’s own junkyard) and dran (banksy’s protégé)—fill the wall space upstairs, while the basement’s ‘seedy, old-school soho feel’ is an attempt to recreate the atmosphere of old. but it’s when the art interacts with its surroundings that lights of soho feels special and unique. light, refracted through delicate hand-blown glass, beams onto the floor below, whilst other pieces can be manipulated in various ways, which end up producing stunning light patterns on the walls. it’s a nice touch, a way of making the environment enjoyably interactive.

>we’re really starting to feel like we’re providing a cool home for artists to display their artwork and also hang out in the evening.

it’s lights of soho’s willingness to combine innovation with a respect for soho’s past that’s prompted a positive ‘response from the art community’. with around 1000 approved members already, hamish feels as though the community is coming together: ‘we’re really starting to feel like we’re providing a cool home for artists to display their artwork and also hang out in the evening.’

so what’s in store for lights of soho? ‘we’re building a community and we want to take it global’, hamish adds. ‘we plan on bringing lights of soho to new york, the reeperbahn in hamburg and in the back streets of roppongi in tokyo so watch this space.’ for now, let’s be glad that soho’s future looks brighter.
