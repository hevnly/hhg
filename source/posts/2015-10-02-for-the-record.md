seemingly, the death of vinyl records has been a lamentable but certain fact for a long time. portable tape cassettes, compact discs and the rise of digital music were thought to be permanent nails in the coffin labelled ‘vinyl’. however, a modest but definite renaissance has been afoot since the mid-2000s, visible in sales data but also felt in the hearts and minds of music connoisseurs aware of the unique pleasures of vinyl.

most records worthy of the term were heard first on vinyl, which gives the medium a similarly higher status that it’s supposed usurpers somewhat lack. record jackets are art objects in their own right too, and a few are design classics of the pop culture which vintage fashion is so happily immersed in today.

>its comeback is largely explained by the cultural nostalgia attached to the current obsession with ‘vintage’.

but the design potential of the vinyl format has not been exhausted yet. the ‘ultra’ edition of jack white’s lazaretto features a hologram of an angel that floats as the record spins. in total, the album sold 87,000 units on vinyl in 2014, making it the best selling lp in over a decade.

record store day is another marker of vinyl’s growing popularity. it started in the us in 2007 and the uk followed suit the year after, the third saturday of april dedicated to the celebration of the resuscitating trade. ‘rough trade records’ are one such company enjoying the attention. a music label and a chain of shops, they celebrate the day by releasing special editions of classic records alongside the latest offerings by their signed artists. more vinyl is being sold on the high street generally, with collette in paris, dalston’s ln-cc and urban outfitters among the notable outlets.

>the mixture of vintage and contemporary records on offer throughout the year reconnects the generational chains of their customers, introducing the new school to the old and vice versa.

perhaps no-one is doing more to preserve vinyl culture more than colleen murphy, founder of classic album sundays. once a month, she chooses an album and plays it in a different london venue through the choicest sound system, tailored to both the music and the room. last month featured aphex twin’s ‘selected ambient works 85-92’ at the unique brilliant corners, dalston. damon gough, a.k.a. badly drawn boy, has been among guest speakers at previous events. they are largely hushed affairs, centred around the appreciation of great records heard in optimum conditions, audiences bearing witness to the indisputably higher sound quality of vinyl. the enterprise has expanded of late; similar nights are now on in oslo and new york.

generally, vinyl collectors purchase across a range of other mediums, so it would be wrong to state that vinyl is a reaction against streaming. rather, the two coexist, the latter accompanying our on-the-go lifestyle and the former allowing for a refreshing break from it.long may the vinyl revival continue.
