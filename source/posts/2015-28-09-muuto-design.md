Anthracite, cognac, rose, and tangerine; in the world of design, common greys, brown, pink, and orange have a full spectrum of their own. In a pale-set room, a rich midnight blue sofa can fill it with warmth. A lackluster corner can be lifted with a vibrant mustard ottoman. Both deeply considered and not given a thought to at all, colour in design is a primary player in its achievements.

Prescribed with as much deliberation as one would while personally choosing an item for the home, designers elect colours which not only work best for the article but also for the collection as a whole.

>Muuto’s name stems from the finnish word muutos meaning “new perspective”

Colours occur when the brain interprets light signals reflecting off objects. While most people experience the same results through processing, technically speaking, every person has the ability to render it differently. The blue you see, while still blue to someone else, may not be precisely the same. Thus making the concept of colours completely subjective. So how then, in a division that is so impressionistic, can one design on colours for others?

Scandinavian interiors company Muuto’s name stems from the finnish word muutos meaning “new perspective”. A fitting choice when drawing upon its in-house team of designer’s personal ambitions, passion, and experiences to put forth a definitive point of view.

Nina Bruun is the project manager for design and product development. Born into a family of creatives and equipped with a master’s in furniture and spatial design from the royal danish academy of design, Bruun utilizes her deft ability of forecasting trends to produce—among other things—new colours, textiles, and line extensions for the brand. “The color palette is a very important part of Muuto’s visual identity,” bruun explains. “Many people characterize muuto through our colors.”

>When developing our color palette I have to trust my gut feeling more than anything else.

Having the main principles down, Bruun looks inward when updating the Muuto range, “when developing our color palette I have to trust my gut feeling more than anything else.” On top of which, she looks outside of the industrial design field for inspiration as well. “I try to forecast 2-3 years ahead, with the help of the international fashion weeks and their shows,” she divulges. “I try to decode the different fashion tendencies and translate them into my field, picking out the colors that I think are a natural extension and development of our existing color palette.”

Indeed, breaking down the intricacies behind Muuto’s dusty green pendant lamp—one of Bruun’s favourite palettes—certainly proves to be more of a process than just a fleeting afterthought. And as for Bruun, whose life is so deeply enveloped in such splendid colours, it’s an entire world of expression.
