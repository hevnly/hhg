Disco music, now most commonly associated with gaudy themed parties and regretful new years costumes, was at one time altogether different. Disco music was revolutionary! It may seem unlikely but these bright lights and ‘boogie nights’  changed society in a profound way.

As the sound of R&B and motown began to merge with the aesthetics and tastes of the hippie and psychedelic movements a new sound began to emerge, and in the summer of 69, a routine police raid at a gay bar on Christopher Street that got out of hand, gave birth to sexual politics and ultimately led to an explosion in disco’s popularity.

*The Stonewall Inn after the riots*

The Stonewall Riots became a catalyst for revolution within the gay community. This new level of sexual freedom and the repeal of a key law that forbade two people of the same sex dancing together, created the ideal environment for disco to thrive. Dance parties held in downtown lofts sprang up everywhere, and with them came the earliest manifestations of club culture - the most famous of these loft parties was hosted by the unlikely godfather of disco, David Mancuso, who’s musical style is summed up in a quote he gave to Village Voice "Like with sunrise and sunset, how things would build up into midday. I took this sense of rhythm, this sense of feeling…”

So successful were his loft parties that a number of other private disco’s were modelled after them. Most famous of these was The Gallery a venue that crystallized the early disco sound. Tracks like Love Is The Message - perhaps one of the first disco anthems became an iconic dance track in it’s own right.

Soon one venue would eclipse all that came before it. Studio 54 was far and above the biggest nightclub in the world at the time and in turn hosted some of the biggest stars of the era from Rod Stewart to Calvin Klein. Open a mere 33 months the venue came to symbolise the frenzied liberalism of the time.

*The entrance to Studio 54 - where Steve Rubell would often determine who was worthy of entry*

Set against the backdrop of a crime ridden and almost bankrupt New York Studio 54 suited the nightcrawler’s who remained. If you were lucky enough to gain entry you soon came to realise that Studio 54 was an experiment in creating a “New Society” - as Andy Warhol put it. Club goers from all walks of life were mashed together in a euphoric haze, these moments famously captured by Hasse Persson now stand as a testement to perhaps the best club in history or at least, the most debauched.

>I admire the accomplishment at a distance - we were a couple of guys from Brooklyn - but we created a Frankenstein monster that almost destroyed us.

But the success of the venue ultimately served as it's downfall. Within its first year Studio 54 had made 7 million, the clubs owner Steve Rubell was quoted saying 'only the mafia made more money'. Studio 54 was soon raided by Inland Revenue and money was found stashed throughout the building, with the owners now sentenced to three and a half years in prison for tax evasion. The party had ended, but not without leaving it's mark on club culture.
