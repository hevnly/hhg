Charlie Casely-Hayford cuts a striking and elegant figure in his Seven Sisters studio - these same words could a be applied to any collection from his eponymous luxury menswear label: Casely-Hayford. Headed up by Charlie and his father, Joe, Casely-Hayford is a label that represents, for Charlie, “a time where a lot of boundaries are no longer relevant”. Merging traditional craftsmanship from the English tailoring with modern innovation, Casely-Hayford’s collections blur distinctions to create a sense of contemporary class that is simply unparalleled.

“Duality plays a strong role in everyone’s lives” Charlie explains, “and we try to reflect that in our clothing.” Since its inception in 2008, the central ethos of Casely-Hayford has been the duality between Anarchy and Sartorialism, although Charlie is the first to recognize his clientele are never “exclusively one or the other”. Where both society’s and fashion’s rules are quickly changing, Casely-Hayford represents a modern freedom that has not lost touch with the importance of quality, a stance that has established a wide ranging clientele. “The Casely-Hayford man wants to wear cashmere tracksuit bottoms and a longline hoodie one day and an unstructured suit the next”. This dissipation of parochial style executed with exquisite attention to detail emerges in various elements that give each piece its own character. Oversized and elongated outerwear is explored to create ‘a parachute effect in movement’. The most relevant contemporary styles are constantly deconstructed, or ‘deflated’ as in the case of the Windless deflated leather puffa jacket, to give a luxury twist. And this character is prevalent in all aspects of the designs. Each piece is given a name that range from the poetic, ‘Eden’ to the more playful ‘Dwayne’ (given to the ‘Modernist Bowling Shirt’). ‘Relaxed’ cuts are found in all areas of the label that show a deliberate stretching and re-imagining of the tailoring craft but at the same time an eye for sartorial detail and precision lends even the most understated and minimalist pieces a sense of refinement.

And who better to navigate this liminal space between tradition and innovation, than Charlie and his father Joe. Joe Casely-Hayford OBE, styled stars such as The Clash, ran his own eponymous label and has a background in Saville Row, eventually becoming Creative Director of Gieves and Hawkes. It was in this period the idea to collaborate first emerged: “In Paris backstage after the Gieves show”, Charlie still remembers, “we had the pivotal conversation about working together.” Such a prestigious partner would be daunting for any twenty-two year old still at university, especially when that partner is your own father. But for Charlie, this was an environment he’d always known: “I essentially grew up in a studio from a very young age. My parents both met studying fashion at Central St. Martins when they were 21 and have been working together ever since.”

The young designer had already began forging his own path by styling stars from Nas to Jamie XX, an experience which has fed into the label: “My Dad and I style each runway so a lot of what I learnt before is still very relevant for the development of the brand now.” The A/W 2016 collection builds on this trans-generational relationship by returning to youth culture, more specifically how British anti-establishment subcultures have coopted the military uniform. For Charlie this opens a dialogue between “a code principally associated with the establishment or uniformity and a message for individualism.” In the collection vibrant patterning meets muted khaki and deep olive green. In continuation with previous collections, oversized, sometimes floor length, outerwear, is complemented by exaggerated military insignia where in other areas of the collection the careful attention to cut and fit provides a deliberately militaristic precision.

This precision is also manifest in a growing personal tailoring service - an area where the fashion conscious “still desire craftsmanship.” When Saville Row is too old-school, Casely-Hayford can offer what Charlie calls “a modern dynamism while respecting the tradition of tailoring.” It is this element of the label that allows Casely-Hayford to exist alongside, what Charlie describes as, “the transiency of both fashion and social media”. While influencers and social media play an important part in disturbing the rules and boundaries of fashion that can lead to innovation, this acceleration of both “the pace of the industry and the consumption of fashion” also has more negative consequences as this transiency “does not marry well with craft and luxury” as Charlie explains, “craft and luxury by definition require time” and this change of pace therefore “leaves many independent designers a difficult place”. But it is in this place that Casely-Hayford comes into its own, truly engaging with new rules “outside of the traditional fashion lexicon” and yet never forgetting the importance of traditional craftsmanship.

From styling, to designing, to providing personally tailored suits with a choice of three thousand fabrics, Charlie has a breadth of knowledge and experience few designers of his age can compete with, but it is the way these facets are brought together that truly set him apart. “I feel the industry will change drastically over the coming years” muses Charlie, but if anyone is ready for the future it is Casely-Hayford, a label that knows not to neglect the past.
