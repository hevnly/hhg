In 1986, six recent graduates from Antwerp’s Royal Academy of Fine Arts rented a truck, filled it with their collections and made a trip over the channel to the London Fashion Week Trade fair in a move that would define fashion for the decade and beyond.

These designers were Dries Van Noten, Ann Demeulemeester, Dirk Van Saene, Walter Van Beirendonck, Dirk Bikkembergs, and Marina Yee. Trained by Linda Loppa, the avant-garde designs of this tribe would put Antwerp on the map and though they all went on to develop individually with their own distinct styles, this example of youthful belief set the path for later Belgian designers such as Raf Simons and Bruno Pieters.

Building on the deconstruction of fashion emanating from Japan, and the ever growing importance of ready-to-wear fashion, these six designers would take on these influences with an energy and confidence that could flourish in a city with a population of half a million, a city free from hierarchy and a dogmatic fashion culture.

>It was a commitment to individuality that united the group.

Dries Van Noten was born into fashion with both his father and grandfather working as tailors. Growing up visiting menswear shows around the world with his father, Dries was introduced to all aspects of the fashion world before settling on designing. Consistently avant-garde and often labelled ‘cerebral’, Dries Van Noten’s collections have been characterized by bold colors and the combining of unique fabrics from a genuinely eclectic and international range of inspirations. This combination perfectly complemented the nineties period, a zeitgeist which Van Noten is able to capture more arrestingly than maybe any other designer. This intellectual approach sewn together with a love for subtle twists was often at odds with the more minimalist movements at large over the years but has left Van Noten as one of the most consistently relevant of the Antwerp Six, a feat that is matched in his still independently run label, based in Antwerp, that stays true to the original emphasis of the group. By only releasing a male and female ready-to-wear line each year, a disciplined and principled approach allows ideas to developed naturally and carefully to create collections that never fail to inspire.

*Dries Van Noten - Spring Summer 1997*


Residing in Antwerp and Belgium’s only building designed by Le Corbusier is Ann Demeulemeester. Demeulemeester had already launched her eponymous label in 1985 but would continue to challenge conventions with the independent label until her departure in 2013. Moving in a darker direction, Ann Demeulemeester’s sharp, almost gothic, designs blurred distinctions of gender with masculine and feminine working their way into all collections be they menswear or womenswear, a feature that was a natural fit with a main influence emerging in Patti Smith. The poetic and romantic come together effortlessly  with elements of roughness and rebellion in asymmetries that create a beautiful tension, a tension that feels as distinctly contemporary as it did in 1986.

Dirk Bikkembergs has been fusing fashion and sportswear long before the recent surge in interest. Beginning with football dress, Bikkembergs exploration of technical fabrics has led to the first fashion show to be held in a football stadium. This fascination with high-performance garments has led to innovation within materials and design that make Bikkembergs one of the most dynamic and singular designers today.

Marina Yee situated her workshop in the centre of Antwerp in 2003. Her work and choice of material is often loosely conceptual, focusing on reclaimed clothes and materials that give her designs an ethereal resonance that also feed into her award-winning theatre costume designs.

>If any of the group retain and reinforce the spirit of the Antwerp Six it is Dirk Van Saene and Walter Van Beirendonck.

Both still teach fashion design at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts where the group originally emerged with Van Beirendonck head of the fashion department. Dirk Van Saene has garnered a reputation for individuality by refusing to follow trends. Citing imagination as central to his process and designs, Van Saene maintains these principles in releasing limited, carefully put together pieces and lines in personally selected locations. Walter Van Beirendonck’s individuality is manifest in the inexhaustibly bold, often surreal aspects of his designs. Fiercely and conscientiously political, his calls for tolerance are explored in the radical nature of his collections that have included, amongst other accessories, butt plug pendants. Constantly warping the distinctions between fashion, fantasy and art, Walter Van Beirendonck’s collections directly mirror his ethos, an ethos expressed recently in an article for Business of Fashion that was an impassioned defence of fostering individual creativity rather than business acumen in fashion education.

The Antwerp Six emerged at a time where the traditional fashion lexicon was being broken down, but also at a time where globalization was changing ideas of community. In this new environment, talent was not just more easily unearthed but could also be thrust in your face whether you wanted to see it or not, as those six fashion graduates proved. Now this sense of community is unrecognizably larger. Social media and the accelerated nature of consumption leaves opportunity open for innovation and self-publicity like never before. But these changes also homogenize community and have heralded the loss of a tangible connection to ones immediate surroundings - everyone is trying to be different, everyone looks the same. In a time were genuine individuality has never been so sought after and yet so hard to find, the example of a few truly unique designers choosing to stay true to their roots and their small city could be more relevant than ever.
