Rebelliously crossing the well-defined lines between art, commerce, pop and subcultural concerns, the spectrum of Takashi Murakami’s creative pursuits are seemingly limitless. Murakami is arguably one of the most notable and important Japanese artists working today yet, “The Japanese Andy Warhol”, the brush with which many critics paint him, does not do justice to the complex and wide-ranging work of  the prolific artist. And while it is likely on the most overused, if not reductive monikers in the book, the Warholian model does support a valid point of departure for understanding Murakami’s oeuvre. Unquestionably, Murakami simply cannot be reduced to being a mere disciple of the American Pop master, his influence on Japan rivals Andy Warhol’s on the United States, and he is known for publicising and promoting pop art strategies in the most unpredictable and novel ways.

Murakami’s artistic practice is expansive, spilling unreservedly into fashion, film and numerous commercial endeavors. In addition to producing some of the most iconic paintings and sculptures in the previous two decades, his extra-commercial work extends to designing a full range of consumer merchandise (either for his own Kaikai Kiki label or for household fashion names such as Louis Vuitton and Comme des Garçons), managing a gallery that promotes young Japanese artistic talent and to hosting a weekly radio talk show in Tokyo. His works unify strands of culture that are usually considered disparate; traditional Japanese painting with Western influences, penetrating the realm of fine art entwined with the animated “otaku” lifestyle (juvenile culture obsessed with toys, anime, and videogames), and commercial retail environments complemented with museums and inspiring break-out spaces - Murakami’s work is acknowledged and respected for its ambition, flair, and deft execution.

Ignoring his international appeal, Japanese culture takes the center stage of his work - whether it be in devoted, sacred forms, or in more spectacular pop likeness. While his nationalism might not always be quickly or easily decipherable to Western audiences, his multi-faceted ventures can be understood as a campaign to reverse the tide of Japan’s postwar cultural inferiority complex and overturn American pop-culture dominance, by capturing both the western market share and widespread imagination with more powerful Japanese manifestations and content.

While Murakami’s artistic practices are comprehensive, his symbols and interest come from far more complex impulses. His works exhibit resistance, a gesture that clearly indicated in Murakami’s critique of culture rather than simply adding to its excesses. His artwork, oft noted for its explicit use of colour, incorporation of motifs from Japanese traditional and popular culture, flat/glossy surfaces, and idiosyncrasies that can be described in one breath once as “cute”, “psychedelic” or “satirical”.

Without a doubt, this talented Japanese artists is at the peak of the art scene and market. The key to his success stems for his ability to reduce the contemporary cultural environment, especially that of Japanese society and its relation to the West; especially, to the United States of America. Murakami has created and presented a type of art that is very well received as much in the sacred halls of international art, his images are disturbing and beautiful, and, above all, full of ideas.
