In the early 1980’s, with New York’s street culture at its apex, cartoonish figures began appearing on the on black, unused advertisement boards of the subway. Drawn with white chalk, these nameless images struck a chord with a culture and a city. They were the works of Keith Haring, an artist who’s pop-art style would leap from the subways to high-art, to a foundation for political activism that has rendered Haring one of the definitive figures of the decade.

Born in Pennsylvania in 1958, Haring’s father was an amateur cartoonist. Early, and perhaps unlikely, influences emerged in the creations of Charles Schultz and Dr Seuss. Haring studied commercial art from 1976 to 1978 in Pittsburgh but lost interest and it was his maintenance job at the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts that allowed for tangible inspiration by introducing Haring to the possibilities of contemporary art. Moving to New York to study painting, it was again off the beaten track inspirations that took prevalence. The works of William Burroughs and studying semiotics with Bill Beckley were important but it was the freedom and voice of street art and graffiti that resonated most powerfully with Haring.

It was in this medium that Haring’s vibrant, blockish, and now iconic, figures were developed. ‘The Radiant Baby’, dancing, faceless characters, his dogs that portray a frenzied movement and positivity, all conveyed strong messages of unity. These messages attacked the atomic bomb, America’s foreign policy and also the social politics at home, especially in regard to sexuality.

Between 1982 and 1989 and in dozens of cities around the world, Haring completed public works, murals that are now destination spots such as ‘Crack is Whack’ on New York’s 128th Street or his take on ‘The Ten Commandments’ in Bordeaux. By this time friends with Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Madonna among others, Haring had cemented his position at the heart of pop-art. His Pop Shop in the SoHo district of Manhattan sold T-Shirts, toys, reproductions of his art and an assortment of imaginative, playful objects. Like all creatives involved in that movement, Haring’s commercialism saw some criticism from the art world and beyond. Haring’s eloquent response to these accusations instantly reveals the hypocrisy’s at the centre of such criticism and the art market itself: ''I could earn more money if I just painted a few things and jacked up the price. My shop is an extension of what I was doing in the subway stations, breaking down the barriers between high and low art.''

Not content to simply break down barriers in abstract conceptions of art, Haring’s approach to his work, making it digestible and democratic, had higher responsibilities than financial gain. Openly gay and a dedicated advocate of safe-sex, both Haring’s work and life would become synonymous with a far more tragic aspect of the 1980’s: the AIDS crisis.

In 1988 Haring was diagnosed with AIDS and his premature and tragic death would come just two years later. In the short interim Haring dedicated his energies to his work and to challenging the oppression and lack of representation felt by victims of the crisis. The Keith Haring Foundation was formed in 1989 to provide both funding and imagery to AIDS organisations. The vibrant simplicity and positive nature of Haring’s style made the increasingly pronounced references to AIDS both incredibly poignant and hard-hitting.

Haring will no doubt be remembered for his brilliance as an artist; however, in a decade, rightly or wrongly, synonymous with rampant individualism and greed, it was Haring’s inexhaustible compassion that leaves his legacy so necessary for our own times.
