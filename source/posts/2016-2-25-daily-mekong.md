Through a foreground of delicately positioned gladioli stems, past blurred budding florets, the ribbed texture of Daily Mekong’s Sarin linen top is comparatively sharp. As part of its first read­yto­wear collection, the image is striking yet demure.

“I designed the ready­to­wear collection, thinking about what I would want in my wardrobe,” explains Sylvie Khoy, founder and creative director of the label. “I wanted a wardrobe that’s smart, elegant, comfortable, and timeless. I wanted a bit of sexiness while still looking proper. A wardrobe that I can wear both in Paris and in Phnom Penh.”

Born in France but of Southeast Asian descent, Khoy’s first capsule collection is a homage to her dual heritage. “It was important to me to keep my roots,” she shares. The name itself denotes a nod to the transboundary Mekong river which hails from the Tibetan Plateau, rushes down through the Yunnan province in China, and elapsing Cambodia and Vietnam before its final sweep into the South China Sea.

A rich property found within the collection is Khoy’s blend of contemporary lines and Parisian sensibilities with long-­established Southeast Asian details. Characteristics which compliment the French femininity, such as wrapped waists and floor-­length hemlines, are similarly reminiscent of datejime belts found on Japanese kimonos and á o dài, the Vietnamese national costume. Styled with original accessories - large coiled bangles inspired by traditional Khmer jewellery - there is a clear and strong connection to Khoy’s lineage exhibited in the collection’s lookbook, released earlier this year.

Having studied International Business at university, Khoy interned under other fashion labels. From a designer in London to Dior in Paris, she specialized her Master’s degree in Fashion Management.

“I think some people are born with a talent of creativity. In my case, I developed it by research, being curious, and gathering inspiration from everything around me: my friends, my family, my travels.” Yet an apt design mind seems to run in the family. “My mom was a pattern maker, she always designed my clothes when I was little. I guess that’s where it started.”

But as evolution would have it, Khoy has taken calculated steps towards her first comprehensive collection, starting with a simple t-­shirt line. “I wanted to have a t­-shirt line that would suit everyone from 10 to 65 ­years old - something timeless. I also wanted to take the opportunity to teach people some simple French words and phrases.” A tiny seedling which has grown and lead to the present.

“I started my first T-shirt collection for fun, I did not expect that it would get the feedback and support it did but starting that was a good challenge,” she explains. “It allowed me to see what it takes to assemble a ready­to­wear line. Things like production, quality control and delivery deadlines. After a year, I was more confident designing the collection.”

With all that said and done, as the new collection launches, so does the latest chapter in Khoy’s life. Relocating from Paris to Cambodia, an entire world of inspiration waits at her doorstep.

When asked what she hopes to achieve in the future, Khoy earnestly
confesses, “I’d love to show people another image of Cambodia—give back their noble letter. Cambodia was destroyed by war and the country is rebuilding itself step ­by ­step. I’d love to contribute to that restoration with Daily Mekong.”
