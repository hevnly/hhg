After World War II, much of London had to be rebuilt. Whole areas had been devastated, and there was an increasing demand for urban renewal. And so began the work of redevelopment: massive, city-wide, and modern. ‘It was as if a meteor had crashed into silk street,’ said one resident, describing the enormous excavation site that came to be the barbican arts centre. Known as ‘the city’s gift’ to the people of London, the arts centre took over a decade to build before it was officially opened in 1982. Despite being widely acknowledged as one of the most significant urban architectural achievements of the 20th century, the barbican had—and still has—its detractors. A 2003 poll named it ‘London’s ugliest building’.

*The integral ingredient of the barbican centre*

The Barbican’s concrete design pays homage to ‘brutalism’, a term derived from the french beton brut (literally, ‘raw concrete’). Generally speaking, brutalism focuses on the function of a building rather than its aesthetic appeal. But function over form wasn’t the only thing that drove the rise of brutalism: concrete was, and remains, cheap. The Barbican cost a total of £156 million to build (£500 million in today’s money), which is about half the amount it cost to construct the millennium dome. No wonder, then, that concrete proved popular in a Britain still recovering from the war.

Concrete, though, wasn’t to everyone’s taste, and some residents were left unhappy. the area had been transformed into a 43-acre dystopian landscape, a landscape that wouldn’t look out of place in a Stanley Kubrick film. (A Clockwork Orange, which is set in and around a brutalist cityscape, was released in 1971, the same year that the building of the arts centre commenced.) The problem for the residents was that there was plenty of concrete (enough to make 19 miles of a six-lane motorway) but not enough jungle: people began to miss greenery, plants, leaves, and trees. some kind of natural relief was needed to complement—but not soften—The Barbican’s harsh and imposing aesthetic.

The solution was a conservatory. Not only would a conservatory provide much-needed greenery but, the architects reasoned, it was also an opportunity to showcase thousands of exotic plants, ones that would not normally survive in Britain. Above all, the Barbican’s innovative design and aesthetic would not have to be compromised. The conservatory was built within the arts centre, and was ‘designed to wrap around the theatre fly tower’.

*The ‘hidden tropical oasis’*

Nearly thirty-five years after it was built, the conservatory remains more or less hidden, concealed by the concrete mass of the arts centre. It’s peculiarly inconspicuous given that it’s the second largest conservatory in London (the biggest, of course, is at kew); it’s probably not a place that you’d just stumble across. To get there, you walk through the arts centre, enter a lift to then walk outside again before bearing right and eventually reaching what the barbican describes as their own ‘hidden tropical oasis’.

>Once you’re inside, you understand why

Here, in the middle of the city, are over 2,000 species of tropical plants and trees (some rare and endangered). Within the peaceful conservatory plants creep up walls and thick trees bow overhead, while fish roam in their large ponds. Certain species are so diminutive that they demand your full attention just to be seen, while others are so large that they can’t be missed and everywhere you turn there’s colour.

A highlight of the conservatory is the cactus room, in which home to myriad cacti and a host of other exotic species. The lithop, or ‘living stone’, are one of the more interesting plants in the cacti room. A master of camouflage, their colouration resembles the soil that surrounds them, making them almost impossible to find. It’s easy to forget, and sometimes hard to believe, that such plants exist.

The Barbican Conservatory is the perfect escape on a Sunday afternoon, away from the bustle of the city. Even though some were dissatisfied with the arts centre, nobody could complain about this oasis in the centre of the city. This, it seems, was the real gift to the people of London.

Barbican conservatory is open every Sunday (11am – 5pm) and on bank holidays (12pm – 5pm). for more info, see visitor information at [http://www.barbican.org.uk/visitor-information/conservatory](http://www.barbican.org.uk/visitor-information/conservatory)
