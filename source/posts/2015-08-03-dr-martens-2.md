dr. martens: an idea first conceived of on the battlefields of world war ii; later part of the most influential subcultures of the 20th century; and now just as comfortable on the catwalk. a journey that stands true to a promise of durability, and a journey by no means over yet. it was in 1945 that klaus märtens, an injured doctor in the german army, first thought to improve his standard-issue boot by attaching a layer of tyre to the sole. in creating a padding of air that combined durability with comfort, märtens innovated the boot in a way that meant the same soles still prop up workersacross the world today.

utilizing rubber left over from germanyʼs deserted airfields, märtens and old friend dr. herbert funck were able to build their brand and idea. however, it was not until fifteen years later that ‘dr. martens’, as they are recognisable today, were created. in a small northamptonshire village, bill griggs, having attained patent rights for the uk, began selling to workers an eight-eyelet boot available in black or oxblood, finished with yellow stitching.

>this was the boot that would go on to become emblematic of generations worth of subcultures; from mods to grunge, skinheads to punks.

for many wearers, these cultures and their icons – pete townshend, sid vicious, kurt kobain – are why fifty year old dads and their teenage daughters find themselves in the same shoes.

and yet, the brand has never been content to sit on their classic status. taking that same masterful approach and penchant for innovative design, dr. martens have now been recognised for their high fashion potential in a series of collaborations.an example would be raf simonsʼ 2009 “metallic” pack which truly removes dr. martens from the factory floor.

>now more than ever the original lines are being explored and developed for their own aesthetic worth.

the elegance behind the classic designs, integrated with the spirit of rebellion that the footwear has come to represent, are embellished with a haute couture exuberance to intoxicating effect.ever pervasive, dr. martens have also piqued interest in street-wear circles with designs from bape and the inimitable yohji yamamoto; a designer more usually seen breaking boundaries with his avant-garde sneakers via diffusion label ʻadidas y-3ʼ.

everybody wants a chance to enter the dr. martens legacy because it is one keeping pace with fashions finest. and all this time dr. martens are still worn for work. they are an official part of the uniform for transport for londonʼs employees and an unofficial part for countless artists, musicians, baristas – the list goes on. with a perfect synthesis of practical design and a timeless, but tough, aesthetic simplicity, dr. martens will always point to yesterday and will always hold their own at the forefront of contemporary footwear.
