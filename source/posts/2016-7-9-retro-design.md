The 80’s was a decade of extremes. With the rise of new tools and materials available to creatives and the rampant commercialisation of entertainment, excess and exaggeration rebelled against and warped previous notions of tradition. This aesthetic of exaggeration reflected bold hopes for the more technologically driven future merged with a nostalgia for the past. This tension has become even more pronounced in our contemporary landscape, rendering the 80’s a decade still so distinctive, and yet ever relevant.

In this two part feature, Hevnly will be delving into some of the most iconic, and also peculiar, manifestations of 80’s style that infiltrated art, design, literature and, of course, fashion.

## Neon Noir

This was predominantly a film genre that took the Noir feature into the contemporary. Think Miami Vice, To Live and Die in L.A., or the French classic, Diva. Cityscapes, synth and the sharpest of Italian suits come together to take the worlds of seedy criminals and street smart antiheroes to new, delightfully over-the-top, heights. Soundtracks would be more likely to contain dripping synths from the likes of Berlin based group, Tangerine Dream, than raucous orchestral scores and fedoras were replaced by the most cutting edge styles from Europe, the aforementioned Italian suit at the centre.

*Drive (2011) - Nicolas Winding Refn*

One need look no further than Nicholas Winding Refn’s Drive, to see how this genre has recaptured the imaginations of today. Beautiful (and long) scenes lifted by 80’s electro-pop, custom Chryslers, visceral scenes of brutality and neon credits meant that Ryan Gosling barely had to say a word in a film where the aesthetic spoke for itself.

## ‘80s Deco

A return to the Art Deco style of the 1920’s and 30’s occurred throughout design. Fonts and graphic design returned to the classical, with a Roman Numeral style (See Miami Vice again). Also in interior design, grecian arches, potted tropical plants and exposed cream concrete and marble made a return. This sense of elegance and grandeur was both a perfect fit and jarring opposite for the more garish manifestations of the 80s.

*Vaporwave - Aaron Campbell*

Vaporwave, a sensation of the past few years, takes this juxtaposition to new levels. Palm trees, Grecian statues and purple sunsets are met with low quality windows 97 style graphics and logos from the corporate heavyweights. Ethereal, garish and tongue in cheek, there is clearly a similar, albeit more internet driven, nostalgia for the simultaneous future and past that was so prevalent throughout ‘80s style.


## Memphis-Milano

This style was one of the most polarizing design movements of the 1980’s. Brainchild of Italian designers Ettore Sottsass and Michele De Lucchi, among others, the use of bold and varied colours matched with audaciously varied geometric forms changed commercial design forever. They drew inspiration from Art Deco and Pop Art to create designs that were unmistakably modern and challenging. Their innovative use of colour and materials such as wood, glass and metal and plastic rejuvenated traditional materials and styles for a commercial generation.

*Christian Dior’s 2011 Autumn/Winter*

The influence of the movement continues to be felt, most notably in the fashion world where bold statements and beauty can come together. Christian Dior’s 2011 Autumn/Winter collection was based solely around the style, as was the Missoni Winter collection of 2015 and the style also inspired some of Karl Lagerfield most iconic pieces. Even though it was easily misunderstood at the time of its inception, the postmodern madness of the style has proved irrepressible.
