Around the same time that Adidas began collaborating with Run-D.M.C., rival brand Nike started designing footwear for basketball legend Michael Jordan. The deal became one of the most lucrative collaborations between a black cultural icon and a big commercial brand.

But the collaboration didn’t get off to a good start. It was decided by the NBA commissioner that the trainer, designed by Peter Moore, didn’t contain enough white and therefore broke the NBA clothing rules. and so each time Jordan stepped onto the court he was fined $5000.

But, of course, this only generated demand. and perhaps more importantly, it helped the brand develop and sustain the image they wanted. Air Jordan 1s, it was known, belonged to those who were out to break records—but didn’t mind breaking the rules either.

The unprecedented success and popularity of the Air Jordan brand marked a new era. And it’s a legacy that is still felt now. Currently sponsoring 21 NBA players, the Air Jordan brand remains huge long after the eponymous star’s retirement. the trainer was a watershed moment in the ongoing relationship between mainstream black culture and popular culture.

But where does black culture stand in relation to popular fashion culture today?

As outlined in part one, it’s clear that popular mainstream culture has a history of “borrowing” many of the innovations that have come out of black subcultures. This was particularly obvious in the music world. But now, it seems, the relationship has changed and, with that change, grown more complex. Not least due to an increased awareness about the ethics of borrowing.

That’s why, for instance, new t-shirts of Tupac or Biggie—or any big cultural icon who isn’t able to personally benefit from the profit—might raise some difficult questions. Where is the money going? Who receives it?

Imagine a legitimate t-shirt of Kanye, produced and distributed by a legitimate brand, going on sale in the high street. It’s obvious where a lot of that profit will go. Kanye is big enough to dictate exactly where his image ends up. He was, after all, the first notable black artist to collaborate with both Adidas and Nike. They were both desperate to be affiliated with him.

It’s likely that Rihanna is doing well out of her collaboration with Puma. The same goes for James Harden and his sponsorship with Adidas. But these figures are rare. And they aren’t necessarily representative of black culture. They are examples of the global celebrity who also happen to be black.

The relationship is more difficult to untangle when it comes to high fashion. In September 2014 DKNY models sported baby curls on the catwalk. You don’t have to be a TLC fan to know that baby curls, popularized by Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas, became a major trend in the 90s. But who is owed what? And is it ok for FKA Twigs to showcase her baby curls on stage but not the (mostly) white models walking down the catwalk during New York fashion week?

The same issue arises when we see popular and successful white artists like Taylor Swift wearing chunky jewellery in her music videos. We only need to look back as far as Run-D.M.C. Again to realise how influential they were in popularising that trend. And the same goes for bantu knots (worn by Gwen Stefani and Miley Cyrus for example) and parachute pants (worn by MC Hammer and, now, every american female celebrity caught on camera doing their grocery-shopping).

These are testimonies that illustrate just how influential black cultural icons have been in shaping popular culture and some of the major trends that have come about in recent years. But tracing the roots of these major fashion trends runs the risk of overlooking some of the more immediately influential figures that are shaping popular culture now.

Ozwald Boateng, Londoner by way of Ghana, was the first designer of African heritage to set up shop on the prestigious Savile Row. Boateng was responsible for creating suits not just for Will Smith and Jamie Foxx but also the entire Ocean’s 13 cast. Although already a sartorial force, Tracy Reese shot to fame when Michelle Obama started to wear her dresses on the world stage. Beyonce, Eva Longoria and Alicia Keys also helped her cause. The first lady was also instrumental in popularising Duro Olowu’s range of vibrant patterns.

These are just some of the contemporary figures shaping the trends and fashions we see in the media and online—though maybe not the names we are used to hearing about.
