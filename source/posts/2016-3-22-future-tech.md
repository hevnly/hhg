If you haven’t come across a pack of runners in your neighbourhood, you’ve surely come across it on social media. Through the proliferation of tags such as “crewlove” and “nevernotrunning” the rise in running’s traction as an aesthetic and athletic activity can quite literally be traced by the mile. With it and other hyper-popular methods—yoga, pilates, crossfit—innovative and technically engineered garments and accessories are being designed to evolve with every stride.

Gone are the days when mainstream training technology meant a Kellogg’s Special K step counter that came free with a box of cereal. Enter the era of conductive copper thread woven into your shirt which syncs up to your phone via Bluetooth. Or a pair of socks which monitor and feeds back your running form in real time. from specialized brands like Hexoskin and Athos to prevailing names such as Nike and Adidas, more and more labels are paying attention to the “Athleisure” sector. And that’s no surprise considering sales in the market came to $35-billion in 2014, according to research firm, NPD Group. That share accounts for roughly 17% of the entire u.s. clothing market.

*The now ubiquitous Nike Flyknit*

The broad term “Athleisure” encompasses as much as the apparel they categorize want to achieve. On the simple and more familiar end of the spectrum there are the moisture-wicking fibres, four-way stretch elastic, and highly reflective prints. But flirting with a forward-thinking and nearly science-fictional end, companies like physiclo plan to develop and incorporate technology into their garments that will stimulate muscles to physically support and enhance the efficacy of a workout. The latter of classes is perhaps better described as “Smart Fitness Wear”.

Not to discredit bigger thinking ideas as fanciful, the merits of Athleisure and Smart Fitness Wear demonstrates a more practical and sustainable shelf-life than most other exercise equipment. Technology analyst from NPD Group, Ben Arnold, points out that other devices and fitness trackers are often abandoned by fickle consumers due to the nuisance of having yet one more thing to consider. When there are already so many hurdles people have to overcome in order to fit in a proper workout, eliminating one that seems frivolous is easy. Where with smart garments, everyone already has to don some article of clothing to exercise in.

>Why not have your shirt, shorts, or leggings be the equipment?

But beyond its function, is its form. the research and development departments of a company like Physiclo are spending equally as much time into the design of the look as they are the technology—taking two years to develop a sleek, black short. And with brands like Arc’teryx and Ralph Lauren, who are both venturing in with technical athletic wear, sacrificing their established and highly regarded style isn’t something they’re willing to do.

So perhaps, the next time you see a crew, solo runner, or pass by a gym, take a closer look. Their workout gear could be working just as hard as they are.
